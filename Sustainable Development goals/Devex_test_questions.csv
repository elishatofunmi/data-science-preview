We see in European governments and the European Commission a clear responsibility to promote the right to health in developing countries. In particular, we frame our calls around UN commitments that are still to be met by our governments.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Health as a Human Right was established by the International Convention on human rights, more than 60 years ago.&nbsp; The goal for governments to provide every individual access to basic health care was already set as a global standard in 1978 at Alma Atta, with a goal established for the year 2000. The HIV/AIDS epidemic of the late 20th century pushed back the expected progress. In 2000, 189 countries renewed their commitment and signed the Millennium Declaration, to eradicate poverty and to make the right to development of world&rsquo;s poorest countries a reality.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>The so called Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), with a target date of 2015, represent a global partnership promoting poverty reduction, food security, gender equality, education, maternal health and aim at combating child mortality, AIDS and other diseases.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Three out of eight of these goals focus specifically on health:</p>    <ul>    <li>Reduce child mortality</li>    <li>Improve maternal health</li>    <li>Combat HIV/AIDs, Malaria, and other diseases.</li>    </ul>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>What we call for:</strong></p>    <p>We call for Europe to urgently adopt a concrete and measurable plan to support developing countries reach the MDGs by 2015 and to allocate all the necessary financial resources to implement it.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Action for Global Health believes that if the health MDGs are to be met, Europe and the international community must make available, with no further delay,&nbsp;full financial resources to respond to the health needs of the world poorest countries; prioritising the development of&nbsp;strong health systems&nbsp;that count with a well-resourced health workforce; and ensuring&nbsp;fair access&nbsp;to comprehensive primary health care to the poorest and most marginalised populations.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Achieving further progress on the health MDGs will require the underlying shortfalls of weak health systems; inadequate financing of the health sector in developing countries, and inequitable access to health services to be addressed. This means taking&nbsp;urgent action to deliver universal access to primary health care, including preventative services and will require a rapid scaling up of efforts to address the weaknesses in health service delivery caused by huge shortages of human resources, drug stock-outs and inadequate funding, alongside more concerted efforts to&nbsp;remove the social, cultural and financial barriers&nbsp;that prevent many people in low and middle-income countries from accessing the healthcare that they need. &nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>"103541,Organization,"Scottish Association for Mental Health (SAMH): <p><span style=""font-size: 11px;"">Around since 1923, SAMH currently operates over 60 services in communities across Scotland providing mental health social care support, homelessness, addictions and employment services, among others.</span></p>    <p>These services together with the national programme work in See Me, respect<em>me,&nbsp;</em>suicide prevention, sport and physical activity; inform the policy and campaign work to influence positive social change.</p>"52382,Organization,"Singapore Immunology Network: <p>The Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN) was launched by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) with the aim of expanding and strengthening immunology research in Singapore.

CRPE works primarily in low-income communities and communities of color.</p>    <p>The&nbsp;work is rooted in California's San Joaquin Valley. The Valley is home to the worst air pollution in the nation, some of largest waste dumps west of the Mississippi, intense oil and gas production, and a dense agricultural landscape that has complex air and water issues. It is also the nation's poorest region, according to the Congressional Research Service, which means it lacks the resources to fight these issues. The Valley counties of Kern, Kings, and Fresno rank last in the nation in income, education, and health outcomes. But, it is also home to people with a&nbsp;<strong>robust vision for change and the willpower to make it happen</strong>. The Valley has a history of resiliency, culture and power. It is where the farmworkers movement originated, which resounded across the nation and had tremendous impact. CRPE builds on this rich tradition and it allows us to scale up our work at the state and national levels.</p>    <p><strong>Theory of Change</strong>&nbsp;CRPE believe social change comes from the ground up. Low income communities and communities of color most impacted by pollution need to define the problems and craft the solutions for their communities. We combine community organizing, legal representation, policy advocacy, and coalition building to create power and systemic change. From the beginning, CRPE has operated with the unique understanding that&nbsp;<strong>legal advocacy needs to be community based</strong>&nbsp;to be successful. CRPE&rsquo;s founder, Luke Cole, wanted to move away from the top-down approach of lawyering to the idea that lawyers should be ""on tap, not on top."" This remains the key principle of our work.&nbsp;<strong>We represent the needs of our communities and work directly with them to achieve their goals</strong>. We strongly believe that &ldquo;communities speak for themselves.&rdquo; We help establish community groups that can advocate for their needs and work together with CRPE.

This FOA reaffirms NIDA's, NIAAA's and OBSSR's continued commitment to major programs of research on behavioral and integrative treatments. The term ""behavioral treatments"" is used here in a broad sense and includes but is not limited to: psychotherapies, cognitive, relapse prevention, remediative, rehabilitative, skills training, counseling, family, and exercise therapies. This also includes screening, brief, computerized, adherence, and prevention interventions for HIV risk behaviors, as well as intervention that target therapist training and fidelity. Integrative refers to combinations with other treatments, including medications or complementary and alternative (CAM) treatments. The development of putative targets and mechanisms of behavior change, and the use and development of valid and reliable assessment tools are crucial to the three Stages of treatment research supported under this initiative:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Stage I (treatment generation, refinement) encompasses all activities related to the creation of a new behavioral intervention.&nbsp;This stage also includes the modification, adaptation, or refinement of an existing intervention (Stage IA).&nbsp;Stage I culminates in feasibility and pilot testing (Stage 1B).&nbsp;For example, one can conduct Stage I studies in research settings, with research therapists and research subjects; or in community settings with community providers. &nbsp;</li>    <li>Stage II (&ldquo;Efficacy&rdquo;) research consists of experimental testing of promising behavioral interventions in research settings, with research-based therapists/providers.</li>    <li>Stage III (&ldquo;Efficacy in Real-World&rdquo;) research consist of experimental testing of promising behavioral interventions in community settings, with community-based therapists/providers and patients, while maintaining a high level of control necessary to establish internal validity.</li>    <li>Stages I, II, and III all include&nbsp;a focus on&nbsp;theory-derived, targets/putative moderators, mediators, and change mechanisms that underlie the treatment, and studies that optimize combined, sequential, or integrated behavioral/pharmacological treatments.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Significance</strong></div>    <p class=""regulartext"">Behavioral treatments play a critical role in most evidence-based substance abuse interventions, and often constitute the entire treatment. This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is intended to promote Stage I treatment and intervention development research. This FOA (in conjunction with the companion FOAs using the R01 and R03 mechanisms) will support Stages I through Stage III of behavioral and integrative intervention research so that better interventions are developed as the science advances, and so that these treatments and interventions are better tailored to individuals and more readily transported to the community. Over the past two decades, numerous evidence-based behavioral and integrative treatments for substance abuse and addiction have been created. With recent advances in science and neuroscience, it is evident that in order to improve clinical outcome, more can be done to incorporate new scientific discoveries into behavioral treatment and intervention development. In addition, as we learn about how these treatments work, and as new technologies become available, more can be done to make treatments and interventions more easily transportable to community settings. To achieve these goals, the Behavioral and Integrative Treatment Development Program, is continued.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">For alcohol abuse and dependence, most of the treatments available in the U.S. also have been behavioral in nature. A large number of clinical trials have demonstrated effectiveness for several types of behavioral therapies, including cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational enhancement therapy, marital family therapy, brief interventions, and the community reinforcement approach. Although progress has been made in a broad range of behavioral interventions to treat alcohol abuse and dependence, many alcoholics do not respond adequately to currently available behavioral therapies. For alcohol abuse and dependence, this FOA supports research to develop new innovative behavioral therapies or modify existing treatments to improve their effectiveness and devise ways to improve the engagement, retention, adherence, and outcome of alcoholism treatment across various populations of alcohol dependent and abuse subjects. This includes, where appropriate, research to develop new interventions or modify existing treatments for use among racial and ethnic minority populations.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">The Stage Model is a model of behavioral intervention development composed of six stages: basic science (Stage 0), intervention generation, refinement, modification, and adaptation and pilot testing (Stage I); traditional efficacy testing (Stage II); efficacy testing with real-world providers (Stage III); effectiveness research (Stage IV) and; dissemination and implementation research (Stage V). Under this FOA, intervention development is viewed as iterative, recursive, and bidirectional; Only Stages I, II and III are supported under this FOA.</p>    <p class=""regulartext""><strong>Stage I</strong>:&nbsp; Stage I encompasses all activities related to the creation of a new behavioral intervention, or the modification, adaptation, or refinement of an existing intervention (Stage IA), as well as feasibility and pilot testing (Stage 1B).&nbsp;Stage I may involve translational basic to applied (sometimes referred to as &ldquo;T1&rdquo;) research. Stage I also may involve the modification or adaptation of interventions for ease of implementation in real-world settings.&nbsp;For example, projects can be conducted in: research settings, with research therapists/providers, but it can also be done in &ldquo;real world&rdquo; or community settings, with community therapists/providers. One goal of a Stage I project is to provide necessary materials and information to proceed to a later phase Stage I, Stage II or Stage III project.&nbsp; An equally important goal is to obtain scientific knowledge of the processes that lead to behavior change (i.e., behavioral, cognitive, social or biological change mechanism).</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Stage I research is iterative and may involve: 1)&nbsp; identifying promising basic or clinical scientific findings relevant to the development or refinement of an intervention; 2) generating/ formulating theories relevant to intervention development and putative change mechanisms; 3)&nbsp; operationally defining, and standardizing new or modified principle-driven interventions; 4) initial or pilot testing of the intervention; 5) experimentally testing the mechanisms and principles of behavior change of the intervention; and 6) as necessary, further refining the intervention.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">This Stage Model presumes that intervention development is incomplete if no materials and methods are available to ensure faithful administration of an intervention.&nbsp;Therefore, therapist/provider training and fidelity assessment and enhancement methods are an integral part of behavioral intervention development.&nbsp;Research on the generation, modification, and pilot-testing of training and fidelity intervention/procedures for community providers are important Stage I activities, whether conducted prior to taking intervention to an efficacy study, or after an intervention has proven efficacious.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Stage I research can be conducted to generate, modify, refine, adapt, or pilot-test: 1) behavioral treatment interventions; 2) HIV prevention interventions; 3) medication adherence interventions; 4) components of a behavioral intervention; 5) therapist/provider training and supervision interventions; 6) interventions to ensure maintenance of the fidelity of intervention.&nbsp;</p>    <p class=""regulartext""><strong>Stage II</strong>:&nbsp; Stage II research consists of testing of promising behavioral interventions in research settings, with research therapists/providers while maintaining a high level of control necessary to establish internal validity.&nbsp;It also involves examining mechanisms of behavior change.&nbsp;</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Stage II does not specify a particular research design. Testing of interventions may be done in randomized clinical trials, but may also be conducted using other methodologies as appropriate (e.g., adaptive designs, multiple baseline single-case designs, A-B-A designs, etc.). Stage II studies may include exploration of intervention components, dose-response, and theory-derived moderators. &nbsp;</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Proceeding from Stage I to Stage II (or Stage III in the case of an intervention developed in or ripe for a community setting) presumes that promising pilot data exist. If sufficiently strong evidence of promise does not exist, but if there is a good rationale for additional modification of the intervention, such modification can be proposed in a subsequent Stage I study.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Information obtained from Stage II studies may be used to inform future Stage I studies. For example, if it is shown that an intervention works for some people, but not for others, especially if such moderator effect makes conceptual sense, a Stage II study may lay the groundwork for a Stage I application aimed at developing an intervention (or modifying the intervention) for people who were unresponsive to the initial intervention.</p>    <p class=""regulartext""><strong>Stage III</strong>:&nbsp;Stage III research determines efficacy in community settings, with community therapists/providers.&nbsp;Although Stage III occurs in real world settings, investigators should maintain a high level of control to establish internal validity.&nbsp;Proceeding directly from Stage I to Stage III requires Stage I research to be promising, and requires the existence of methods to ensure fidelity of delivery of an intervention, along with therapist training materials (as required by the intervention).&nbsp;</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Stage III does not specify a particular research design.&nbsp;Testing of interventions may be done in randomized clinical trials, but may also be conducted using other methodologies (e.g., adaptive designs, multiple baseline single-case designs, A-B-A designs, etc.).&nbsp;Stage III studies may include examinations of intervention components, dose-response, and theory-derived moderators.&nbsp;</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Information obtained from Stage III &ndash; or Stage II &ndash; studies may be used to inform future Stage I studies. For example, if it is shown in Stage III that an intervention works for some people, but not for others, a Stage III study may lay the groundwork for a Stage I application aimed at developing an intervention (or modifying the intervention) for people who were unresponsive to the initial intervention.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Examination of the mechanism of action of interventions is considered to be an integral part of all Stages of intervention development research.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">The objective of this and the two companion announcements is to ensure sufficient emphasis and support for Stages I through III of behavioral and integrative treatment research, so that scientific knowledge can be incorporated into newer and better behavioral, combined behavioral and pharmacological, integrative and CAM treatments, and so that treatments can be effectively transported from research to the community.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Specific Areas of Research Interest</strong></div>    <p class=""regulartext"">The overarching goal of this FOA encourages Stage I research to produce maximally efficacious behavioral interventions (individual and group) &ndash; to treat drug abuse, promote medication/treatment adherence, and prevent HIV &ndash; that take advantage of new knowledge in neuroscience, new technologies and of medications that may improve tangible outcomes of behavioral interventions (e.g., improving cognitive function).&nbsp;Also included is Stage I research HIV prevention interventions for individuals in substance abuse treatment. This may involve creating novel treatment interventions, modifying or adapting existing interventions, and incorporating novel intervention components into existing treatments or interventions. This may also include the development, modification, adaptation or improvement of integrated or sequential treatments for populations with substance use disorder(s) and co-occurring medical and/or psychiatric condition(s). This research may be conducted for any substance of abuse, including illicit drugs, prescription medications, nicotine, alcohol and multiple drugs. Of particular interest are studies that seek to determine basic mechanisms of behavior change within the context of behavioral treatment intervention research. Therefore, applicants are expected to include (and if necessary develop) measures of proposed mediators, mechanisms and moderators of behavior change relevant to their intervention. This may include, for example, behavioral, cognitive, social, affective, and/or neurobiological measures. Research conducted via this FOA may consist of Stage I treatment development research that will provide feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability information and/or pilot data.&nbsp;In addition, relatively small Stage II or Stage III research may be conducted under this FOA.

According to the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), an estimated 21.7 million people aged 12 or older, or about 8.1 percent of that segment of the population, needed treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs) in the past year. Substance use often begins during adolescence, and its effects are more long-lasting and resistant to treatment than when initiation occurs during adulthood. Additionally, substance use often co-exists with other psychiatric disorders, can involve the use of multiple substances, and is more prevalent within certain populations such as those positive for HIV/AIDS infection and among individuals having chronic pain. SUDs are serious national health issues; understanding their neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms would enable us to develop strategies for effective treatment and prevention.</p>    <p>Drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing neurobehavioral disorder that is characterized by the compulsive self-administration of chemical substances despite their negative consequences. NIDA-supported research has made significant progress in identifying the mechanisms of action, at a genetic, molecular, cellular, and systems level of analysis, for each major drug of abuse. In addition, there is a reasonable understanding of the changes that occur in the brain as a result of acute exposure to drugs. However, there remains a need to know more about the changes that occur during the different stages of SUDs: initiation of use, transition from volitional to compulsive use, abstinence, relapse, and successful recovery. Similarly, we need to understand how pharmacological, behavioral, or other therapeutic interventions affect the brain and which mechanisms the brain uses to protect itself from the deleterious effects induced by chemical substances. Finally, we currently have a limited understanding of individual differences resulting in differential susceptibility and resilience to SUDs. The research encouraged by this FOA should lead to improved understanding of SUD, its determinants and consequences, and potential treatment.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Scope</strong></div>    <p>The evolution and vitality of the biomedical sciences require a constant infusion of new ideas, techniques, and points of view. These may differ substantially from current thinking or practice and may not yet be supported by substantial preliminary data. By using the R21 activity code, the NIH seeks to foster the introduction of novel scientific ideas, model systems, tools, agents, targets, and technologies that have the potential to substantially advance biomedical research.</p>    <p>The R21 activity code is intended to encourage new exploratory and developmental research projects. For example, such projects could assess the feasibility of a novel area of investigation or a new experimental system that has the potential to enhance health-related research. Another example could include the unique and innovative use of an existing methodology to explore a new scientific area. These studies may involve considerable risk but may lead to a breakthrough in a particular area, or to the development of novel techniques, agents, methodologies, models, or applications that could have a major impact on a field of biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research.</p>    <p>Applications for R21 awards should describe projects distinct from those supported through the traditional R01 activity code. For example, long-term projects, or projects designed to increase knowledge in a well-established area, will not be considered for R21 awards. Applications submitted to this FOA should be exploratory and novel. These studies should break new ground or extend previous discoveries toward new directions or applications.</p>    <p>This FOA encourages basic neurobiological studies that use in vivo and in vitro model systems as well as studies in humans. Applicants are especially encouraged to include appropriate behavioral models and paradigms of behavioral components or stages of addiction in their research proposals, especially in response to chronic exposure to drugs, different drug administration regimens, withdrawal, or recovery. The subject of study can be at the level of a single protein or gene, neurobiological system, or the entire organism. Research may be conducted across multiple levels of analysis, and applications that incorporate changes over time and/or across multiple scales (e.g., gene to behavior, abuse to dependence, adolescence to adulthood) are sought. Multi- and inter-disciplinary studies are especially encouraged. Topics that would be appropriate to this FOA are described below, but they are not intended to be exhaustive or exclusionary.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Developmental Approaches</strong></p>    <p>This FOA encourages the conduct of neurodevelopmental studies throughout the lifespan, such as:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Neonatal abstinence syndrome</li>    <li>Research that characterizes neural development and its interaction with abused substances during sensitive developmental periods, such as the peripubertal period</li>    <li>Research on the effects of abused drugs, and those that are potential treatments for drug abuse, on neurogenesis, cell differentiation, proliferation, migration and survival in young and adult animals, including assessment of consequences and reversibility of these alterations</li>    <li>Research during aging, particularly on interactions of drugs of abuse with therapeutic pharmaceuticals</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><strong>Genetic, Molecular and Cellular Approaches</strong></p>    <p>&nbsp;NIDA encourages the use of genetic, such as human genetics, molecular genetics, epigenetics, and pharmacogenetics, cellular and molecular approaches to identify and understand the neurobiological mechanisms underlying addiction.

This includes studies that examine the role of substance use in exacerbating the pathophysiology underlying HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Additionally, research to develop methods and approaches that protect and potentially repair neurons damaged or dysregulated by exposure to combined HIV-1 infection and drugs of abuse, anti-retroviral therapies (ARTs), and/or host inflammatory factors, is needed. Applicants are strongly encouraged to include relevant animal behavioral models or study substance abusing populations in their research proposals.</p>    <p>Chronic Pain: Studies are needed that aim at understanding the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of chronic pain and its treatment by opioid analgesics. Research might include the study of the changes that occur in response to chronic pain and exposure to its treatment; mechanisms that underlie the sex differences in the response to chronic pain; and the development of non-addicting analgesics for the control of chronic pain. For example, the development of non-opioid analgesics or analgesic approaches that combine different classes of drugs with opiates to reduce opioid abuse liability would be of interest.</p>    <p>Psychiatric Comorbidity and Polysubstance Abuse: The high incidence of comorbidity between SUDs and other psychiatric disorders, or the concurrent misuse of multiple substances by individuals, are well documented. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying these associations remain poorly understood. Preclinical and clinical studies could further our understanding of the extent to which these disorders do or do not share a common neurobiological etiology. Research is encouraged that incorporate comorbidity behavioral models or models of polysubstance use to discern the neurophysiological and neural circuitry similarities and differences between these co-occurring disorders.</p>    <div class=""heading4"">Special Considerations</div>    <p>National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse Recommended Guidelines for the Administration of Drugs to Human Subjects:&nbsp;

The goal of this FOA is to promote research that aims to integrate individual factors with community and environmental factors. Population health studies focus on the ""upstream"" level determinants of health &ndash; those basic and primary social factors that are fundamental to group level differences in health outcomes. Population health interventions (PHI) provide a way to advance health by linking research at a variety of different levels and allows for the consideration of scale in accounting for human interaction and environmental factors simultaneously.</p>    <p>PHI research has shown that many health issues can be addressed through a multi-level transdisciplinary approach, and by using a variety of study designs and methods, including classical case control and small community designed studies, experiments (including natural experiments, interrupted time series, and cluster randomized designs) and creative modeling approaches. Population health interventions often involve policies or programs, which address underlying social, economic, and environmental conditions in an effort to shift the distribution of health risks.</p>    <p><strong>Research Objectives</strong></p>    <p>This funding announcement promotes research that utilizes interventions targeting multiple levels, including the individual level (behavioral, familial) and clinical/community level (including the health care system at both the regional and national level).</p>    <p>Applications submitted to this funding announcement should recognize the complexities of the multi-factorial origins of health outcomes, and target more than one of the following, including, but not limited to:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Individual-level factors, such as self-management for health/disease risk factors, stress, and social support.</li>    <li>Environmental factors, such as culture, social system, social context, and the built environment.</li>    <li>Provider-level factors, such as improvements in access, quality of care, communication, systems for promoting trust and adherence, and patient support services (e.g., patient navigation).</li>    <li>Community factors, such as place, developing a social culture of healthy lifestyles, safe environments, and increased choices of healthy foods and leisure activities.&nbsp;</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>Applicants are strongly encouraged to build multidisciplinary teams comprised of researchers from multiple social and behavioral science fields (including epidemiology and biostatistics, social work, urban planning and development, public policy, anthropology, geography, economics, psychology, sociology, etc.) as well as basic health science and clinical researchers.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Individual level interventions need to integrate high-level mechanisms/influences in their analysis.

That is, leveraging NIDA funds with the expertise and resources of researchers at for profit or non-profit organizations (including, but not limited to, academic institutions, pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, private or public foundations).&nbsp;</p>    <p>NIDA anticipates that through leveraging its resources, Strategic Alliances will accelerate the pace of grant-funded medications development for SUDs.</p>    <p>Applications may be focused at any point along the medications development continuum including, but not limited to, the advanced development of new chemical entities (e.g., lead optimization), investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies (e.g., preclinical toxicology, GMP manufacturing), and Phase I, II or III clinical trials of either a new chemical entity or an already marketed therapeutic. The studies proposed should be directed at advancing a medication to treat SUDs toward FDA approval.</p>    <p>Applications from a single entity (private for-profit, non-profit, or academic) will also be considered, with the entity expected to make a significant resource commitment to the proposed project.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The development of safe and effective medications for the treatment of SUDs is a public health priority. Illicit drugs include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants as well as the nonmedical use of prescription-type pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives.</p>    <p>Over the past 20 years, basic research has identified neural substrates and pathways implicated in reward and addiction. However, the application of this basic knowledge to the development of effective medications to treat SUDs has largely been unsuccessful in both preclinical and early clinical stage development, hindered by the costs and high attrition rates of compounds. Later stage clinical development also presents formidable challenges, with prospective SUD medications failing due to lack of efficacy, tolerability and unexpected toxicity, as well as &ldquo;human&rdquo; issues such as difficulties in recruitment, medication compliance and subject loss during the trial and prior to follow up.</p>    <p>While there are medications approved for nicotine and opiate dependence, the efficacy of these drugs is far from ideal.&nbsp; For example, the abstinence rates after 1 year with either nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion is about 2 - 8% and 8%, respectively, higher than that achieved with placebo.&nbsp; Moreover, there are currently no FDA approved medications for the treatment of cocaine, methamphetamine, or cannabis use disorders.</p>    <p>By providing funds well beyond a traditional research project grant, this Strategic Alliances FOA will accelerate medications development, fostering collaborative ventures of NIDA with other entities such that each makes a significant commitment of resources&nbsp; toward the goal of obtaining FDA approval of safe and effective medications for SUDs.

SPD use is particularly alarming with increasing reports of a variety of health consequences, such as heart trouble, vomiting, agitation, confusion, hallucinations, violence, suicidal thoughts, and even death.&nbsp; Still, 11.3% of high school seniors reported use of synthetic psychoactive (SP) cannabinoids in 2012, a rate that is second only to marijuana itself among illicit drugs. Furthermore, over 60% of people admitted to an emergency department in 2011 for their reported SP cannabinoid use were between 12 and 20 years of age.</p>    <p>The illusive marketing strategies deployed by illicit producers of the SPDs and the difficulties associated with identifying and controlling new SPDs are proving challenging for health officials and law enforcement. It is increasingly difficult to predict SPD effects, establish epidemiologic patterns, and prioritize for basic research to gain fundamental knowledge about their pharmacology and toxicology.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the surge of SPD use during the last 8-10 years is a major public health concern and necessitates multiple lines of a research agenda to help counter their increasingly widespread use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p>SPDs can be classified as follows:&nbsp; 1) SP Cannabinoids (THC-mimics, e.g. JWH compounds) are usually herbal products that are contain SP additives that produce experiences similar to marijuana, but can be more potent and unpredictable.&nbsp; This class of drugs appears to be the most commonly abused; 2) SP Cathinones (stimulant-mimics, e.g.&nbsp; methylone, e.g. MDPV [3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone]) differentially interact with several physiological targets and depending on their individual profile, their pharmacology can range from powerful stimulant to hallucinogenic effects; 3) SP Opiates (opiate-mimics, e.g. acetyl fentanyl) tend to be more potent analgesics than morphine, have euphoric and sedative properties, faster onset of action and a shorter elimination half-life, and higher addictive potential than morphine; 4) SP Hallucinogens are structurally related to mescaline, exhibit hallucinogenic properties and can have severe toxic effects; 5) Other SPDs, such as those currently being used overseas and have potential for abuse in the US; and 6) Designer Cocktails, which generally refer to the mixture and abuse of prescription pharmaceuticals and is not a focus of this FOA.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Among the research needs is to establish and understand the receptor targets, signaling pathways, neurodevelopmental, and neurocircuitry effects of these SPDs.&nbsp; Although little is known about their detailed pharmacology, toxicology and metabolism, some of the SPD compounds have shown potent activity at the monoamine neurotransmitter and endocannabinoid systems. There are reports showing that rats self-administer SP cathinones similar to, or more robustly than, methamphetamine.&nbsp; SPDs also demonstrate addictive properties; they can induce intense cravings, tolerance, dependence, and strong withdrawal symptoms.&nbsp; A number of toxicological symptoms have been reported with synthetic drugs. However, the observed effects cannot be relied upon as the typical toxicological profile is a combined result of the drug compound and the non-drug ingredients (how the drug is synthesized and purified) of the dosage form.&nbsp; Because of the lack of available evidence, epidemiologic data and studies on how to treat SPD intoxication are needed.</p>    <p>This R21 mechanism is for exploratory/developmental research.&nbsp; Applicants with novel scientific ideas or new model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical or biobehavioral research, should consider applying for this mechanism.&nbsp; Alternatively, applicants with small well-defined research ideas should consider the companion R03 small grant mechanism.&nbsp; The R03 supports discrete, well-defined projects that realistically can be completed in two years and that require limited levels of funding.&nbsp; Both the R03 and R21 mechanisms are for two years of support.&nbsp; Preliminary data are not required for R03 or R21 applications; however, they may be included if available.</p>    <p><strong>Research Objectives</strong></p>    <p>The goal of this FOA is to support the necessary science to help inform researchers, clinicians, emergency personnel, and policymakers of the current epidemiologic trends, mechanisms of actions, and the clinical strategies to mitigate the consequences of these dangerous SPD compounds.</p>    <p>Epidemiological data generated will be the main guiding force for research directions, which will consist of basic research into the analysis of the new products and development of detection techniques, methods development and preclinical evaluation. Concomitantly, research on clinical evaluation, determination of toxicological and medical consequences is also needed.&nbsp;</p>    <p>For the purposes of this FOA, priority will be given to research examining the SP cannabinoids and cathinones, although all classes will be considered if well-justified.&nbsp; This FOA will support 4 specific categories of research.

For the purposes of this funding announcement, the term ""1st generation"" refers to people who were born in their native country and relocated to the U.S.&nbsp; The term ""2nd generation"" refers to the U.S. born children of 1st generation immigrants.</p>    <p>In addition, the FOA will further the development of scientific areas, providing support for early-stage exploratory projects that lead to future in-depth intervention studies (such as R01 projects) on immigrant health disparities.</p>    <p>In 2015, the immigrant population in the U.S. was 44.9 million and the immigrant wave is expected to reach around 78 million people (18% of the population) by 2065.&nbsp; Approximately 30% of immigrant families have incomes below the federal poverty level and 23% of today's new immigrants tend to be less educated and have not completed high school.&nbsp; Some immigrant populations suffer a significant burden of disease and healthcare systems face daunting challenges in addressing the health of these populations. Among immigrants, cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, hypertension diabetes and some types of cancers (particularly those associated with infectious agents) are often higher than their counterparts in the general U.S. born populations, although in some groups the rates of CVD and stroke are substantially lower. In addition, many immigrants come from areas of the world where exposures to toxic chemicals are common, such as pesticides long banned in the U.S. at sensitive windows of development, that may increase risk for future health conditions/diseases. Importantly, risk factors and disease outcomes vary by subpopulations among immigrants based on the country of origin; however, many studies consider immigrants as one homogenous group. For example, U.S. immigrants from approximately 20 Latin American countries are treated as one group and not separated into nationality sub-groups, Asians (from more than 30 countries) or Africans are treated as one immigrant group when the health outcomes are often different among different sub-groups.</p>    <p>Factors associated with immigration processes can translate into higher risk for diseases.&nbsp; Moreover, immigrant populations face multiple challenges, such as low health literacy, lack of health insurance, limited English proficiency, barriers to effective patient-provider communication, other limitations in accessing health care as well as maintenance of traditional health practices. Singularly or interactively, these factors that may contribute to health disparities observed in these populations. Factors like the concentration of immigrants in low-income and segregated neighborhoods (ethnic enclaves) and low-wage occupations with exposure to toxic chemicals, poor or other unsafe working conditions may also contribute to worse health outcomes among immigrant populations.</p>    <p>Despite the numerous stressors faced by immigrants, published literature documents that recent immigrants report better health status (e.g., healthy immigrant effect) than U.S. born populations, a status that is thought to deteriorate with length of U.S. residence and in subsequent generations The role that ethnic enclaves, social networks, resilience and acculturation play in explaining some health advantages needs to be further explored. The effect might vary by gender and health outcome focus.&nbsp; Alcohol use among Latina women may drop but among Latino males appears to increase in the first generation in the U.S. How duration of stay in the U.S. coupled with acculturation pressures lead to changes in health behaviors and outcomes and how these factors interact with changes in socioeconomic status are some of the range of factors that need more research.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Therefore, to improve health outcomes in this and improve health outcomes population, there is a need to build an evidence base for effective interventions that could reduce health disparities and improve health outcomes among U.S. immigrant populations.</p>    <p>Given current understanding of the determinants of immigrant health, (e.g. social, environmental, biological and behavioral) and the mechanisms that these determinants act on to influence health status, a well-developed intervention research framework and interdisciplinary approach is needed to address immigrant health challenges.</p>    <p>The R21 activity code is intended to encourage new exploratory and developmental research projects. For example, such projects could assess the feasibility of a novel area of investigation or a new methodology that has the potential to enhance health-related research. Another example could include the unique and innovative use of an existing methodology to explore a new scientific area. These studies may involve considerable risk but may lead to a breakthrough in a particular area, or to the development of novel techniques, agents, methodologies, models, or applications that could have a major impact on a field of biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research.</p>    <p>Applications for R21 awards should describe projects distinct from those supported through the traditional R01 activity code. For example, long-term projects, or projects designed to increase knowledge in a well-established area, will not be considered for R21 awards. Applications submitted to this FOA should be exploratory and novel. These studies should break new ground or extend previous discoveries toward new directions or applications.</p>    <p class=""Heading4""><strong>Research Objectives</strong></p>    <p>Given the scientific literature documenting health inequities among immigrant populations, this announcement calls for exploratory and developmental research to test the feasibility of innovative intervention strategies that will address immigrant-specific factors to reduce health disparities among immigrants, particularly among migrant workers, recent and 1st generation immigrants</p>    <p>The intervention research under this FOA should be aimed at improving the health outcome among immigrant groups by targeting the causes or consequences of health disparities. Multi-level interventions that include a combination of individual, group (such as peers, family members, etc.), and/or community-level intervention components have been shown to be effective in improving health outcomes. Therefore, this FOA strongly encourages multi-level interventions (i.e., ranging from individuals to societies) in addressing U.S. immigrant health disparities.</p>    <p>A life-course perspective is encouraged with interventions focusing attention on transition points across the lifespan and associated risk and protective factors for immigrant populations. Such an approach emphasizes the fact that early life disadvantage need not lead to later negative health outcomes, provided there are compensating experiences in the intervening years. This would also allow consideration of the reasons and the conditions under which the individuals migrated to the U.S. Attention should be given to the positive aspects of lives of immigrants that may buffer the effects of adversity.</p>    <p>Projects should involve collaborations among relevant stakeholders in US immigrant population groups, such as researchers, community organizations, healthcare providers, public health organizations, consumer advocacy groups, and faith-based organizations.&nbsp; As appropriate for the research questions posed, inclusion of key immigrant community members in the conceptualization, planning and implementation of the research is encouraged (but not required) to generate better-informed hypotheses and enhance the translation of the research results into practice.</p>    <p>Interventions that are culturally sensitive and community based addressing population level factors to overcome barriers to improve overall health and reduce health care disparities among immigrants are encouraged. Exploratory research projects are encouraged to utilize rigorous innovative multidisciplinary approaches including biological assessments (such as genomics, epigenomics, microbiome, telomere length, allostatic load, or other biomarkers) to show whether they may serve as measurable indicators for excess risk or health outcomes. Interventions that include health information technology applications (e.g. behavior monitoring tools, decision aids, health information portals, etc.) and/or social media elements to improve immigrant health are encouraged.</p>    <p>The focus of this FOA is specifically on immigrants who, once residing in the U.S., belong to one or more U.S. racial/ethnic minority populations (i.e. Blacks/African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Asians, or Pacific Islanders). Research is encouraged among distinct immigrant sub-populations based on the country of origin, rather than larger racial/minority populations when feasible (e.g., Koreans, Vietnamese, Cambodian, etc., rather than Asian Americans). For projects involving comparisons across populations, these comparisons should illuminate immigrant-specific phenomena rather than representing more global comparisons between immigrants with the non-Hispanic whites or the US general population.

Treatment targets, including behavioral, neurobiological, social, psychological and cognitive/ affective are essential to assessment and treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs). In line with an experimental therapeutics approach, targets are the processes by which substance use disorders are maintained, and the primary focus of the treatment that is developed, refined and/or adapted. Target engagement and validation occur when treatment exacts change on the specified target and when target engagement leads to and/or correlates with symptom reduction outcomes, respectively. Because these target domains are important in terms of assessment and treatment of addiction, and the fact that they have been shown to be malleable in response to treatment, this FOA will encourage studies to capitalize on the opportunities to develop novel treatments with coordinated referents across target and measurement domains. Treatments that incorporate target domains with pharmacological and/or behavioral interventions may help to improve treatment efficacy, retention, relapse prevention and long-term outcome.</p>    <p>This FOA&nbsp;seeks to stimulate research on the improved efficacy of substance use disorder treatment with an emphasis on data replicability across two phases of development: Phase I will include, and replicate, initial findings of target engagement obtained via an R21 study (with clear and specific milestones); and to assess the relationship between target engagement and changes in functional outcomes or clinical symptoms.&nbsp;Phase II will conduct replication studies of substance use disorder treatment across a minimum of 2 settings. This latter phase will facilitate applications (R33) that focus on clinical trials.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p>This FOA is part of an NIH initiative known as Collaborative Research on Addiction at NIH (CRAN;&nbsp;<a href=""http://addictionresearch.nih.gov/"" target=""_blank"">http://addictionresearch.nih.gov/&nbsp;</a>). The mission of the CRAN is to provide a strong collaborative framework to enable the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to integrate resources and expertise to advance addiction research and public health outcomes.</p>    <p>High rates of co-occurring substance use disorders contribute to excess morbidity and mortality, and also are associated with poorer long-term clinical outcomes. Although various combinations of behavioral and pharmacological treatments have been shown to be effective, relapse rates among individuals with substance use disorders remain high.&nbsp;Several factors have been implicated that largely account for these high rates. One in particular is the idea that many existing treatments often fail to capitalize on important target domains that have been linked to substance use disorder (i.e., multiple substances) outcomes including behavioral, neurobiological, social, psychological and cognitive/ affective. These target domains and their underlying neurocircuitry play a critical role in the initiation and onset of substance use disorders (including course of treatment, treatment drop-out, relapse, and clinical outcomes), thereby making these target candidates an essential part of assessment and treatment of substance use disorders. &nbsp;</p>    <p>As conceptualized by a mechanism-focused, experimental therapeutics model, targets are the processes by which substance use disorders are maintained, and the primary focus of the treatment that is developed, refined and/or adapted. Target engagement is essential when evaluating the extent to which the treatment under study exacts change on the specified target. In order to ensure accuracy, it is equally important to validate that the target actually leads to and/or correlates with symptom reduction outcomes. Because these target domains are important in terms of assessment and treatment of addiction, and the fact that they have been shown to be malleable in response to treatment, opportunities exist to develop novel treatments with coordinated referents across target and measurement domains. Treatments that incorporate target domains with pharmacological and/or behavioral interventions may help to improve treatment efficacy, retention, relapse prevention and long-term outcome. An explicit focus on targets also may help to better evaluate and measure changes that correspond to clinically meaningful reductions in substance use or abuse. For example, perhaps improvements in cognitive or sensory deficits may result in decreases in drug use behaviors; changes in risk-taking propensity or greater task persistence also may result in reductions in drug use.</p>    <p>Greater treatment specificity among individuals with substance use disorders is essential in order to move beyond main effects on abstinence rates and better integrate and improve treatment efficiency treatment response-rate results. These fundamental improvements are primed to be facilitated through a mechanism-focused, experimental medicine approach; whereby, identification and engagement of a target through experimentation or treatment, and testing the degree to which target engagement produce the desired behavior change. Additionally, these efforts set the stage for target data to be replicated.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives/Scope of FOA</strong></div>    <p>This FOA provides support for applications designed to (a) generate novel treatments and refine existing treatments and (b) conduct preliminary tests of novel and improved behavioral, pharmacological, and combined treatments for individuals with substance use disorders (multiple substances including alcohol, tobacco and drug dependence) by examining the mechanisms of addiction as putative treatment targets.

With regard to the R21 phase, Stage I encompasses all activities related to the creation of a new treatment, or the modification, adaptation, or refinement of an existing treatment (Stage IA), as well as feasibility and pilot testing (Stage 1B).&nbsp;Stage I may involve translational basic to applied (sometimes referred to as &ldquo;T1&rdquo;) research.&nbsp;Stage I also may involve the modification or adaptation of treatments for greater treatment efficiency and ease of implementation in real-world settings.&nbsp;An equally important goal is to obtain scientific knowledge of the mechanisms of action or putative targets that lead to behavior change.&nbsp;Stage I research is iterative and may involve: 1)&nbsp; identifying promising basic or clinical scientific findings relevant to the development or refinement of a treatment; 2) generating/ formulating theories relevant to treatment development and putative change mechanisms; 3)&nbsp;operationally defining, and standardizing new or modified principle-driven interventions; 4) initial or pilot testing of the treatment; 5) experimentally testing the mechanisms and principles of behavior change of the treatment; and 6) as necessary, further refining the treatment. This approach requires the identification of a theory-derived target based on putative mechanisms of addiction among individuals with substance use disorders, and clear hypotheses about how an intervention directed at changing the target can lead to clinical benefits. Research in the R33 phase is analogous to Stage II and III studies. Consistent with an experiment therapeutics model, target refers to a disorder-maintaining process, which the treatment seeks to modify; target engagement occurs when a treatment in fact modifies this process; target validation occurs when target engagement leads to (or at least correlates with) symptom reduction outcomes; and mechanism of action (how the intervention works) encompasses both target engagement and target validation. Under this FOA, pilot trials should be designed so that results, whether positive or negative, will provide compelling information used to support decisions about further development and large-scale testing of the treatment.</p>    <p>This FOA&nbsp;seeks to stimulate research on the improved efficacy of substance use disorder treatment with an emphasis on data replicability across two phases of development: Phase I (R21 for up to two years) will include, and replicate, initial findings of target engagement obtained via an R21; and assess the relationship between target engagement and changes in functional outcomes or clinical symptoms (i.e., proof-of-principle).&nbsp;This is followed by up to 3 years of support for Phase II (R33) to address data replication. Specifically, Phase II will conduct replication studies of substance use disorder treatment across a minimum of 2 treatment settings. This latter phase will facilitate applications that focus on clinical trials.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Specific Areas of Interest</strong></div>    <p>This FOA encourages applications that focus on early-stage, treatment generation and pilot clinical trials that are consistent with an experimental therapeutic approach. This approach requires the identification of a theory-derived target based on empirical evidence of mechanisms of addiction in individuals with multiple substance use, including alcohol tobacco and other drug abuse. Additionally, this approach requires clear hypotheses about how a treatment directed at changing the target can lead to clinical benefits. The target of a treatment is the hypothesized mechanism by which it modifies functional outcomes. Under this FOA, pilot trials should be designed or tested so that results, whether positive or negative, will provide information of high utility to the field and support decisions about further development of the treatment. In other words, projects should have built-in milestones that provide go/no-go parameters as measured by clinically significant changes. For example, in order to proceed from the R21 phase, there must be target engagement of 20% (i.e., clinically significant change from baseline) in 50% of the sample. Adaptation of interventions with demonstrated efficacy should be undertaken only when justified by a compelling rationale supported by empirical evidence, and where there is a hypothesized target that will be tested within an experimental framework.</p>    <p>The phased approach supported by this FOA also facilitates more rapid translation by moving promising treatment approaches into pilot studies without requiring an additional grant application, provided that investigators meet the agreed-upon milestones during the R21 phase.&nbsp;Cross-disciplinary research teams may be necessary for successful translation of basic science to clinical application.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Although the R21/R33 mechanism does not require extensive preliminary data, successful applications will propose a theoretically-justified model and empirical support for the mechanism involved in triggering or maintaining the disorder, and a scientific rationale for the proposed treatment target. Rigorous tests of a target require objective, quantifiable, reproducible measures of target engagement, at behavioral and/or biological levels. These can include measures of structural (e.g., PET) as well as functional (e.g., behavioral task performance, fMRI circuit activation) target engagement. Additionally, measures can include laboratory tasks that have been previously validated as reflecting underlying behavioral, psychological or neural mechanisms (e.g., go-no-go tasks to measure impulse control, reaction-time to the dot-probe task to measure cognitive attention bias, temporal discount rates to measure self-regulation).&nbsp;Measures of target engagement should be scientifically justified and be as objective and direct as is feasible.&nbsp;Self-report measures can add useful information in a multi-method/multi-measure design that is set to demonstrate construct and convergent validity.</p>    <p>This FOA provides support for up to two years (R21 phase) for preliminary, proof-of-principle studies, that is, studies designed to identify treatment targets, develop the initial protocol, demonstrate target engagement, and explore initial feasibility.&nbsp;This initial phase is followed by up to three years of support (R33 phase) for data replication studies of substance use disorder treatment across a minimum of 2 treatment settings.</p>    <p><strong>Phase&nbsp;I (R21)</strong></p>    <p>The R21 phase focuses on treatment generation or refinement during which investigators (1) identify a treatment target based on empirical evidence of a mechanism of addiction, or mechanism of change for a proposed intervention, (2) generate a preliminary intervention protocol, (3) begin to demonstrate that the intervention alters the targeted mechanism (thus providing an initial proof-of-principle), and (4) provide preliminary evidence that the treatment can be applied in a clinical population with adequate acceptability and tolerability. Appropriate activities for the R21 phase may include identification of optimal parameters of the intervention to demonstrate change in the treatment target or mechanism; determination of optimal &ldquo;dose&rdquo; (e.g., level of intensity, session frequency and duration); and/or develop and validate measures to demonstrate sensitivity to change in the target or hypothesized mechanism.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Applicants who already have sufficient preliminary data to progress to the R33 phase should apply directly to the companion FOA&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-16-352.html"">PAR-16-352</a>.</p>    <p>Examples of applications seeking to generate and test novel substance use disorder treatments include, but are not limited to:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Research aimed at identifying novel targets (e.g., cognitive or sensory deficits, working memory, delay discounting, and/or task persistence) and generating treatments designed to modify these targets.&nbsp;This includes preliminary testing to determine if there is target engagement.</li>    <li>Novel treatments designed to work as a stand-alone to address substance abuse comorbidities&nbsp;</li>    <li>Boost the efficacy to existing interventions</li>    <li>Promote adherence to existing efficacious treatment</li>    <li>Research aimed at identifying neurobiological targets (e.g., receptor deficits, dopamine depletion) and generating behavioral and/or pharmacological treatments designed to modify these targets</li>    <li>Research aimed at identifying targets and generating technology-based treatment designed to modify these targets (i.e., preliminary testing to determine if there is target engagement)&nbsp;</li>    <li>Measure substance use behavior and the identified target in real time and enable the individual to access a technology-based treatment in real time to substance use and abuse</li>    <li>Research to determine whether the treatment engages the intended target and the extent to which a minimum dose is needed before treatment is effective</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><strong>Phase II (R33)</strong></p>    <p>Funding for the R33 phase is contingent on demonstrating target engagement and initial feasibility in Phase I (R21).

Additional pilot work may include (1) further refining initial manipulations of targeted mechanisms; (2) &nbsp;standardizing the treatment; (3) developing a set of assessment and monitoring procedures designed to assess and sustain the fidelity in which the targets of the treatment are engaged; (4) further testing feasibility, safety&nbsp; and acceptability of the treatment; (5) testing the association between a change in the target and subsequent outcomes; and (6) evaluating the feasibility of recruitment, retention, and assessments.&nbsp;Phase II studies are expected to have sufficient power to conduct a strong test of efficacy.</p>    <div class=""heading4"">&nbsp;</div>    <p><strong>Notes on Priorities</strong></p>    <p>Applicants are strongly encouraged to propose projects related to multiple substances, which may include polysubstance use or abuse.

Investigations of the social determinants of health in these populations are needed, including understanding the impact of stigma, the high impact of HIV, minority stress, education, employment, violence, homelessness, and incarceration. More information is needed on relationships with partners and family, as well as on sexual and reproductive health. Successful aging, including the impact of life events, experiences, and interventions such as hormone therapy and surgery are other important topics to investigate.

This initiative aims to generate research within the scope of the parent grant that identifies mechanisms underlying disparities or differences in mental health status and/or enhances optimal delivery of mental health interventions across diverse racial and ethnic, geographical, and socioeconomic groups.</p>    <p><strong>Background</strong></p>    <p>Racial and ethnic minorities tend to have more severe, persistent, and disabling mental disorders; however, members of these groups are less likely to access mental health services, less likely to receive quality mental health care, and more likely to have poorer mental health outcomes. Furthermore, rural residents and people of low socio-economic background have compelling mental health needs, yet they have poorer access to, quality of, and outcomes of mental health care.</p>    <p>NIMH aims to stimulate and support research that results in a rigorous evidence base for effective mental health services and interventions for all groups. This first requires facilitating research that addresses distinctive health characteristics and attributes of people who are socially disadvantaged and/or subject to potential discriminatory acts. NIMH is interested in improving mental health conditions among underserved racial/ethnic populations, including American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asians, Pacific Islanders, immigrants and refugees, and sub-ethnic groups (e.g., Black Caribbean, Chinese, Haitian, Korean, Puerto Rican, South Asian, etc.).</p>    <p>In addition, mental health disparities research has the potential to contribute to our understanding of differences and disparities in risk and resilience factors for mental disorders, prognosis of mental disorders, responsiveness to treatments, and access to and continuity of quality care. The field of mental health disparities research will be bolstered with study designs that adequately address mental health needs of racial and ethnic minorities in genomics, translational, efficacy, effectiveness, and implementation research to detect and understand group differences. Of particular interest to NIMH is disparities research focusing on mental health conditions involving psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, autism, and suicide.</p>    <p><strong>Research Opportunities</strong></p>    <p>Applicants are strongly encouraged to discuss their proposed supplement project with the Program Official of the parent grant before submission of an administrative supplement application in order to ensure that the work proposed in the supplement is consistent with&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/index.shtml"">current funding priorities</a>&nbsp;and is within the scope of the parent grant.</p>    <p>This initiative aims to support research that satisfies priorities in the mental health disparities program. These priorities include: (i) increasing the understanding of mechanisms underlying disparities and differences in mental health status through the study of diverse groups across the lifespan, (ii) reducing disparities in access to, continuity of, quality of, and outcomes of care, and (iii) scaling evidence-based interventions to reduce disparities.</p>    <p>Consideration will be given to research studies in both healthy human and patient populations. Scientific areas of interest for this FOA include the following:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Studies that apply unbiased genomic approaches to assess genetic risk contribution to mental disorders across diverse racial and ethnic groups from different ancestries and are powered to analyze these groups.&nbsp;</li>    <li>Studies that identify early biological and environmental risk and protective factors associated with mental health and their underlying mechanisms across generations and lifespan to serve as potential novel targets for treatment or preventive intervention among diverse groups.</li>    <li>Studies that aim to understand the mechanisms that produce disparities and/or new trends among underserved groups in suicide burden (ideation, attempts, deaths), and potential contributors to suicide risk and/or protective factors.</li>    <li>Studies that examine the roles of genetic and environmental factors underlying inter-individual differences in domains of function across diverse populations, employing the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework.</li>    <li>Studies that interrogate and test community engagement, adherence, and retention strategies specifically designed or modified for diverse populations by altering the mechanism(s) leading to disparities.&nbsp;</li>    <li>Studies to understand, predict, and manipulate factors that mediate or moderate the effectiveness of interventions that increase access to and continuity, quality, and scalability of mental health services among diverse underserved groups.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>Applications with data collection plans that involve multiple respondent groups (e.g., clients/patients, therapists/providers, supervisors, administrators) should address provisions for human subject protections and consenting procedures for all participant groups, accordingly.

These positive trends have set the stage for a complex and paradoxical epidemiology of health and disease as more children survive into adulthood and are affected by the sequelae of combined early illness, malnutrition and adverse experiences. These exposures can also advance the onset and severity of chronic diseases including cognitive and neurodegenerative disorders in later life. Similarly, socio-economic factors, such as poverty, conflict, stigma and gender inequalities, contribute to the initial causes (such as injury, psychological trauma, chronic adversity, genetic vulnerability and infection) of many nervous system disorders. These disorders, in turn create a negative feedback loop handicapping the physical and cognitive ability of individuals and their societies to address the root causes of nervous system disorders and their risk factors. The biological and cultural effects may extend for generations.</p>    <p>Data published in the updated Global Health Estimates for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) (<a title=""Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"" href=""http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/en/"">http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/en/</a>&nbsp;), continues to show that non-communicable diseases and disorders (NCDs) are rapidly becoming the dominant causes of poor health globally, including all LMIC regions with the exception of sub-Saharan Africa, where they are second only to HIV/AIDS, as defined by contribution to years lived with disability (YLD).</p>    <p>Disorders of the nervous system, e.g. neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease, combined with disorders affecting the nervous system, e.g. cerebral malaria, in aggregate contribute the most to the global burden of NCD disease and disability (followed by cardiovascular disease and cancer). They also contribute about a third of the burden due only to NCDs in LMICs (Global Burden of Disease and Risk Factors Report, DCP2, 2006,&nbsp;<a title=""Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"" href=""http://www.dcp-3.org/dcp2%C2%A0"">http://www.dcp-3.org/dcp2&nbsp;</a>and see the Global Health Estimates&nbsp;<a title=""Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"" href=""http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/en/"">http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/en/</a>&nbsp;). The following nervous system disorders account for four out of the six leading causes of YLDs: mental and behavioral disorders, especially unipolar depression and bipolar affective disorder, substance-use, alcohol-use disorders, schizophrenia and dementias.</p>    <p>Maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions (including anemia) along with communicable diseases still contribute disproportionately to Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs, a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health and disability or early death) in LMICs as compared to high-income countries. These conditions may also lead to impairment of nervous system development, function and long-term health (<a title=""Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"" href=""http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/en/"">http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/en/</a>).</p>    <p>Infectious and parasitic diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other neglected tropical diseases as well as emerging diseases such as Zika, are a burden for LMICs, where they continue to be important causes of YLDs by themselves and due to their long-term effects on the nervous system, especially of children. However, very limited data is available on the epidemiology, natural history and pathogenesis of neurological problems caused by these diseases and associated opportunistic infections and co-morbidities in these settings.</p>    <p>Chronic pain, especially of the neck and back, is also now recognized for its large contribution to the burden of disability. Neurological disorders such as epilepsy, migraine, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis make smaller but significant contributions. Stroke and perinatal asphyxia, with neurological complications, are also a significant problem in LMICs particularly since some of the causative factors of stroke such as hypertension are poorly treated in LMICs as compared to high-income countries.</p>    <p>Mental, alcohol and substance use disorders were ranked as the 3rd leading contributors to the burden of disease when the burden attributable to suicide (which is a leading cause of death in many regions) is also considered. Depression, the most common psychiatric disorder, accounts for the largest proportion of suicide-related DALYs.</p>    <p>The incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders and related cognitive disorders (such as mental retardation, behavioral disorders, learning disabilities and cerebral palsy) is less well characterized&nbsp;in LMICs. However, many of the root causes of developmental disabilities &ndash; including genetic and nutritional factors, infectious diseases, environmental toxins, and traumatic events (both pre- and post-natal) are particularly common in resource-poor countries, and their prevalence is high.&nbsp;Early neurodevelopmental disorders, along with disability due to postnatal injury or insult to the brain and central nervous system during infancy or childhood, are clearly a heavy burden in LMICs.</p>    <p>Disability from disease and injury and the need for rehabilitation and accommodation will be an increasingly heavy burden on all health systems. GBD 2010 (<a title=""Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"" href=""http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/news/2012/who_burdenofdisease/en/"">http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/news/2012/who_burdenofdisease/en/</a>&nbsp;)</p>    <p>put an important spotlight on nervous system related chronic disability (and its particularly heavy toll on women)&mdash;from, for example, mental health disorders, substance abuse, musculoskeletal disease, accidents, chronic pain and loss of vision and hearing.</p>    <p>Overall, the burden of neurological, mental, behavioral and substance use disorders together is expected to rise worldwide, as a proportion of the global burden of disease and disability, because of the projected increase in the number of individuals entering the ages of risk for the onset of many such disorders. Humans are living longer and birth rates are down. As recently as 1950, about 5% of the people in the world were over 65 and about 15% under 5. Those numbers are on track to reverse the years 2050. Direct attention to research on diseases and disorders of later life is therefore needed. But the rise of these disorders is expected to be steeper in LMICs, because of the continuing and long-lasting contributing effects of early life trauma, infectious disease and malnutrition, further highlighting the need for research on the influence and impact of early health/illness/treatment, experience and environment on development of those diseases and disorders, across the lifespan.</p>    <p>These problems pose a greater burden on vulnerable groups such as people living in poverty, those coping with disease, and those exposed to emergencies. For example, disaster, war and conflict situations are especially prevalent in many LMICs and may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), this affects a substantial proportion of the overall population exposed to such conditions which may lead to persistent dysfunction on top of already existing disorders. In addition, stigmatization and gender inequality amplify many of the key risk factors for nervous system disorders and contribute to poor access to and quality of treatment.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Lack of adequate prevention and treatment in LMICs is a major contributor to the burden of disease and disability. In some countries, the overall physician-patient ratio can be low as 1:20,000, with even fewer psychiatrists and neurologists. Some disabling brain disorders are readily treatable at low cost, and yet many in LMICs suffer untreated with detrimental individual, family, and societal consequences. For example, epilepsy is a common brain disorder that disproportionately affects people in LMICs (roughly 85 percent of the total number affected worldwide). Although inexpensive and effective treatments are available, epilepsy is frequently untreated and even unrecognized in LMICs, often because of stigmatization and lack of knowledge. For such disorders, implementation science that integrates social and cultural factors into education, media, policy and behavior change research is especially needed and appropriate.</p>    <p>Prevention of disability due to neurological impairment from adverse or toxic environmental exposures is possible in many situations with appropriate research leading to knowledge and interventions. For example, research to identify neurotoxins and their mechanisms can be combined with interventions to minimize human exposure by a reduction in use or release to the environment and by appropriate safeguards in occupational settings.</p>    <p>Despite their enormous burden of disease, nervous system disorders have been largely absent from the global health research agenda.&nbsp;In addition to research on the etiology, prevention and treatment of individual impacts, conditions and disorders, more information is needed on co-morbidities among nervous system disorders and between these disorders and other chronic NCDs. Many of these conditions exist together in LMICs and are likely to have more severe and complicated effects than any in isolation and often extend beyond the individual affected (for example maternal depression as a risk factor for infant stunting). Research on the social and economic impact of neurological, psychiatric, and developmental disorders is needed to inform interventions, implementation and policy.&nbsp;Research is also needed to further define the burden and identify knowledge gaps, needs, opportunities and methods to effectively reduce the burden and to lay the groundwork for developing and testing interventions.</p>    <p>Applicants are encouraged to refer for more background to recent publications summarizing the state of knowledge on the burden of nervous system disorders around the world including the following:&nbsp; Disease Control Priorities Related to Mental, Neurological, Developmental and Substance Abuse Disorders (contains five chapters from the Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, second edition, World Health Organization 2006,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a title=""Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"" href=""http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2006/924156332x_eng.pdf"">http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2006/924156332x_eng.pdf</a>.

Zambia has made strides toward the goal of eliminating the epidemic by 2030, yet key strategic information (SI) gaps remain, creating challenges in identifying programmatic areas needing to be strengthened and priority populations that must be reached to achieve epidemic control. Some of the SI challenges include the lack of a centralized data system, inconsistencies in HIV-related data across multiple sources (i.e., electronic medical records (EMR), district health information system (DHIS), Data for Accountability, Transparency and Impact Monitoring system (DATIM)), lack of capacity for data verification and quality management, limited data on key and priority populations, and a dearth of granular epidemiological data.</p>    <p>CDC Zambia has been working with GRZ and IPs through a number of cooperative agreements to improve data quality and utilizations to support monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) activities, surveillance activities (i.e., HIV mortality, bio-behavioral, ante-natal and HIV case-based) and the standing up of the Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI) in 2016, with ongoing support provided by CDC&rsquo;s Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP).</p>    <p>Although great strides have been made, much SI work remains.

However, many gaps and challenges remain if the country is to reach ambitious targets associated with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Improvements in certain areas, including neonatal mortality and nutrition have been slower than expected. While Cambodia has made strong progress in communicable diseases control, emerging infectious diseases have proven challenging; between 2005 and 2013, Cambodia had the highest numbers of avian influenza H5N1 subtype cases (47) globally.</p>    <p>The Government of Cambodia has made significant progress in addressing HIV/AIDS for the past 25 years. In 2013, Cambodia announced its intent to eliminate new HIV infections by achieving the 90-90-90 targets by 2020 and going further to achieve 95-95-95 (and fewer than 300 new HIV infections annually) by 2025 &ndash; coming close to achieving an AIDS Free Generation.</p>    <p>A critical component of tackling emerging infectious diseases, and sustaining the tremendous gains made against other infectious diseases of major public health importance such as HIV, is a strong national public health laboratory system. Based on a systematic evaluation of the Cambodian national laboratory system between July 2013 and April 2014 supported by WHO and CDC, several weaknesses were identified, including:</p>    <ul>    <li>An ill-defined and/or poorly communicated vision of the public health laboratory system, its governance, and functions</li>    <li>A lack of standardized approaches for laboratory workforce development</li>    <li>Limited participation of laboratories in public health functions, such as surveillance and outbreak response</li>    <li>Critical gaps in implementation of laboratory quality management system (LQMS) practices</li>    </ul>    <p>This NOFO will support NIPH to address these weaknesses through focused efforts on LQMS and achievement of ISO 15189 accreditation, laboratory capacity and coordination for strong surveillance and outbreak response, as well as workforce development in areas of leadership and management.In addition to laboratory systems, robust surveillance systems and use of quality surveillance and program data are critical to tackling infectious diseases. This NOFO will facilitate achievement of the global 90-90-90 HIV goals by strengthening NIPH&rsquo;s capacity to use national HIV surveillance and program data to conduct evaluations of innovative HIV programming implementation, including for HIV case finding, and to translate research findings into policy and public health action. This NOFO will also accelerate efforts within the Ministry of Health (MOH) to address AMR by establishing an AMR surveillance system as well as guidelines for appropriate use of antibiotics, a key component of achieving AMR-related IHR components.</p>    <p>Support through this NOFO is critical for Cambodia to achieve its commitment to develop a country-specific AMR action plan by 2017 as required by signatory countries to the 2015 WHO Global Action Plan on AMR.</p>"11810,Grant,"Strengthening Capacity Through Improved Management and Coordination of Laboratory, Surveillance, Epidemiology, Validation, and Training <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>    <p>In spite of a decades-old national response to HIV/AIDS, the burden of HIV/AIDS in Uganda remains high with a national prevalence of 7.3% and new infections as high as 95,000 in 2014 alone. The availability of services vary, with urban areas better served than poorly served rural areas.</p>    <p>The health system in Uganda aims to deliver a defined National Minimum Health Care Package (UNMHCP) to every member of the Ugandan population. To achieve this, laboratory services must be well managed, coordinated, and funded. Laboratory services in Uganda have lacked the fiscal support required to fulfill their role, resulting in increased health care delivery costs due to inadequate disease identification; missed diagnoses, including absence of a national external quality assurance (EQA) program for HIV related testing; poor case monitoring and management; and delays in disease outbreak management.</p>    <p>Uganda does not have a standalone Quality Assurance (QA) policy for HIV rapid testing, but there is a small section of QA in the National HIV Testing Services (HTS) Policy and Implementation Guidelines version 2016. This section provides detailed processes and all the components of rapid HIV testing QA. With the scale up and need to identify 90% of those infected, there is a need to improve the quality of HIV testing to achieve epidemic control.<br /><br />The primary goal of this NOFO is to provide PEPFAR support to the MOH in its mission to achieve and monitor the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals of 90% of HIV positive individuals knowing their status; 90% of people tested positive for HIV being on antiretroviral therapy (ART); and 90% of those on ART achieving viral suppression. The recipient will support the MOH to address the weaknesses in the quality of HIV testing through interventions which will strengthen the existing laboratory network. These align with Uganda&rsquo;s 2016-2020 National HTS Policy and Implementation Guidelines priorities. This NOFO will implement activities in 112 health districts in Uganda.</p>    <p>Key activities to be implemented in this project include:</p>    <ul>    <li>Ensuring increased and maintained competence in the provision and management of comprehensive, quality-assured, HIV-related laboratory services, including design and implementation of the National framework for tester and site certification, to ensure reliable and accurate HIV rapid test results.</li>    <li>Strengthening surveillance and informatics capacity to ensure evidence-based programming used to generate and analyze data, inform policy development, and guide the development of operational research.</li>    <li>Conducting validations to inform the delivery of cost-effective, evidence-based innovative interventions.</li>    <li>Assisting MOH/CPHL in mentoring and monitoring the performance of laboratories and POCTs participating in the National EQA schemes as a contribution to WHO certification/accreditation schemes.</li>    <li>Developing and conducting training courses in three core competences: laboratory, epidemiology, and informatics.</li>    <li>Assisting MOH/CPHL and MOH/AIDS Control Programme (ACP) in coordination of the National HIVDR program, including HIVDR sentinel surveys.</li>    </ul>"11863,Grant,"Strengthening Capacity for Laboratory Systems, Strategic Information, and Technical Leadership in Public Health for the National Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) Response <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>    <p>Ethiopia has made significant progress in its national response to HIV, resulting in a low overall prevalence in the general population. The HIV epidemic in Ethiopia is characterized by heterogeneity across geographic areas, gender, and population groups. According to 2017 estimates, adult HIV prevalence is 1.16% with variation by region ranging from 5% in Addis Ababa to 0.54% in South region, and by residence (urban 3.64% versus rural 0.58%). Survey on most at risk populations (MARPs) showed 23% HIV prevalence among female sex workers (FSWs), which warrants the need for focused prevention, care, and treatment programs in this key population (KP) group.</p>    <p>The health laboratory system, led by EPHI, follows a tiered structure in line with the healthcare delivery system. The national reference laboratory (NRL) based in EPHI technically assists regional laboratories, which oversee laboratory networks in their respective regions. NRL provides VL, early infant HIV diagnosis (EID), TB culture, and HIV drug resistance testing.<br /><br />EPHI conducts surveillance and surveys on HIV, TB/HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STI), MARP/KPs, and HIV/TB drug resistance. EPHI played an important role in the conduct of the 2005 and 2011 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS).</p>    <p>Due to dynamic program needs, data on HIV burden and size of KP needs updating to timely gauge interventions at various levels. Results of the 2016 DHS will be available shortly while Ethiopia&rsquo;s Population Based HIV Impact Assessment preparation is in place to provide updates to the current status of the epidemic. In addition, HIV programs require reliable laboratory services as these services are indispensable for supporting diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and surveillance. Significant progress has been made in lab capacity building; however, infrastructure, specimen referral, quality assurance (QA) schemes, and equipment and supply chain management are still challenges and need continued support.</p>    <p>Cognizant of these gaps, this NOFO will evolve EPHI&rsquo;s lab capacity building role to align with current prevention, care, and treatment strategies. VL, EID, and TB diagnostics will be scaled up including routine use of DBS, reliable specimen referral system, and introduction of POCT. This NOFO will also support the generation of adequate and timely data by strengthening survey and surveillance programs for evidence-based decisions to guide PEPFAR programs in focusing on high impact geographic areas and population groups. A real-time surveillance system will be designed in case-finding and outbreak investigation methods to identify networks with ongoing or new HIV transmission, which ultimately leads to those in need of prevention services. Strengthening the institutional capacity of the HIV/TB surveillance unit at EPHI to manage both facility and population HIV surveillance system is also critically needed to ensure sustainability of the program. EPHI will continue to standardize/strengthen TB/HIV laboratory infrastructure, survey and surveillance activities. EPHI will also strengthen the NRL and regional laboratories technical and management capacity to support the PEPFAR program in Ethiopia. These interventions are essential contributions to enable Ethiopia&rsquo;s achievement of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals by 2020.</p>    <p>This NOFO may also support other public health system strengthening capabilities, multidisease/condition, surveillance, response, prevention and control under the responsibility of EPHI, in coordination with CDC-Ethiopia.</p>"12189,Grant,"Addressing Critical, Multi-sectoral Response Actor Capacity Gaps for Infectious Diseases at the Humanitarian Emergency Scale (GPN) <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>    <p><strong>A. Background </strong></p>    <p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Office for Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), is publishing the subject Request for Information (RFI) in order to obtain information and input from all interested public and private parties on Infectious Disease (with Epidemic or Pandemic potential) Standby and Augment Capacity for a Humanitarian Emergency. This only applies to Infectious Disease events that require designation of a Level-3 Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) and those has been declared a Public Health Emergency (PHEIC) of International Concern (or are the equivalent of a PHEIC). This new Standby Capacity project will address critical, multi-sectoral response actor capacity gaps needed to maintain technical and operational readiness to ensure rapid response to infectious diseases outbreaks with epidemics or pandemic potential (i.e. influenza, viral hemorrhagic fevers, etc.) that reach the scale of a humanitarian emergency. This may include activities such as (but not limited to) contingency planning; the development or adaptation of toolkits, training, or technical guidance; establishment of rapid response teams; and enhancing coordination mechanisms.</p>"12232,Grant,"Epidemiology and Risk of Novel and Seasonal Influenza Viruses and the Value of Prevention, Treatment, and Mitigation Strategies for Annual Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Response <p><strong>Background and Purpose</strong></p>    <p>The National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), Influenza Division (ID), seeks to initiate a cooperative agreement with the Thailand Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), Nonthaburi, Thailand, to develop the evidence base and best practices to define the pandemic risk of novel influenza viruses and other respiratory pathogens circulating in humans and animals. Objectives also include supporting MOPH priority work to determine the impact and cost of seasonal influenza among vulnerable populations; assessing the value of influenza and other respiratory pathogen vaccines, antiviral medications, and other mitigation strategies; and evaluating optimal strategies for influenza and other respiratory pathogen vaccine delivery, communications and adverse event monitoring, to inform vaccine program optimization. It is desired that sustainable best practices, identified through this cooperative agreement, will provide useful strategies that may be implemented in Thailand and in neighboring countries in Southeast Asia.</p>    <p>In 1997, highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus emerged in China and resulted in several outbreaks in poultry and infections in humans that affected other countries in Southeast Asia. By 2004, influenza A (H5N1) virus had spread to humans and birds in Thailand. In 2013, the first human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus were reported from China and the virus has now resulted in more than 700 human infections in China with sporadic detection in other countries. Although Thailand has yet to be affected by avian influenza A (H7N9) virus, Thailand&rsquo;s proximity to China, and the frequent transit of people and goods to and from China, places Thailand at high risk for the introduction of A (H7N9) virus. The continued detection of novel viruses in Asia, coupled with the possibility of genetic mutations or re-assortment with constantly circulating human influenza A viruses, underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and the development of an evidence base for best practices related to novel influenza virus detection, preparedness, response, and mitigation strategies within the country. Among countries in Southeast Asia, Thailand is also uniquely positioned to conduct enhanced surveillance, program evaluations and implementation research to assess risks and approaches to optimize strategies to prevent and control seasonal and novel influenza viruses. Thailand has a WHO-designated National Influenza Center and a WHO Regional Influenza Reference Laboratory for the South-East Asia Region, with the capacity to rapidly identify both A (H5N1) and A (H7N9) influenza viruses. Thailand also has multiplex PCR capacities at selected regional locations and, at the national level, conducts influenza virus isolation and sequencing activities. The Thai National Influenza Center regularly passes WHO and CDC proficiency panels and routinely shares viruses with international WHO Collaborating Centers for Influenza and the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. A virus isolated in Thailand has been in the recommended influenza vaccine composition since 2015.</p>    <p>Thailand also has an influenza vaccination policy that has been in place for more than 10 years and is one of few middle-income countries with a local vaccine manufacturer which is currently developing pandemic influenza vaccines. The government of Thailand, through the National Vaccine Program Office, procures approximately 3.1 million doses of influenza vaccine annually for distribution in the public sector. Recommended target groups for influenza vaccination in Thailand include pregnant women, young children, the elderly, healthcare workers and persons with chronic diseases. These target groups represent a population of about 12 million persons in Thailand. Thus, despite an existing influenza vaccination policy, influenza vaccination coverage remains at less than 10% for most target groups, demonstrating the need for additional data to guide vaccine uptake.</p>    <p>During the last 9 years, CDC&rsquo;s Influenza Division has collaborated with the Thailand Ministry of Public Health to enhance influenza surveillance to better understand influenza seasonality, determine risk factors for severe disease, support effective and timely outbreak response, and estimate morbidity and mortality attributable to influenza virus infections. However, data remain limited. The objectives of this NOFO are to: define the pandemic risk of novel influenza viruses circulating in humans and animals; determine the impact and cost effectiveness of seasonal influenza among vulnerable populations; assess the value of influenza vaccines, antiviral medications, and other mitigation strategies; and determine optimal strategies for vaccine delivery, communications and adverse event monitoring. In addition, because of the recent emergence of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus, and the ongoing circulation of other avian and seasonal influenza viruses in the region, program evaluations and research to better detect, respond, prevent and control influenza remain crucial to protect the populations of Thailand, Southeast Asia, and the global community</p>"12233,Grant,"Public Health Epidemiology of Influenza Virus Infection and Control     <p><strong>Background and Purpose</strong></p>    <p>The National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), Influenza Division (ID), seeks to initiate a cooperative agreement with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), Beijing, China. The purpose of this collaboration is to support enhanced influenza surveillance and applied research to better define the global risk of novel and seasonal influenza virus infections in humans and animals in China, the region and the world. The scope of research performed will include, but will not be limited to, activities that: a) determine the impact of influenza among vulnerable populations; b) assess the value of antiviral medications, vaccines and other mitigation strategies, and c) support and guide seasonal epidemic and pandemic influenza prevention and control studies. Research activities for the prevention and control of novel influenza viruses and pandemic preparedness activities will be aimed at preventing and controlling the spread and transmission of novel influenza viruses to other countries, including the United States. Continued monitoring, detection, and reporting of these novel influenza viruses in China will advance efforts to inform global health infection control policies and prevent and control seasonal epidemic and pandemic influenza in countries around the world.</p>    <p>In 1997, the highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus emerged in China and resulted in several outbreaks in poultry and infections in humans that affected other countries in Southeast Asia. The last human infections with A (H5N1) virus in China were in 2016. Since 2003, there have been 53 human infections with A (H5N1) virus in China and, of those, 31 (59%) have died. In 1998, the National Health and Family Planning Commission in China also reported human infections with avian influenza A (H9N2) virus. Whereas the A (H9N2) influenza virus tends to cause milder illness in humans than the A (H5N1) virus, it continues to circulate. To date, there have been 34 human infections reported from China out of a total 41 reported worldwide. In 2013, the first human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus were reported from China. Through five annual epidemic periods, approximately 1,561 human infections were reported. Of those, approximately 90% resulted in severe illness and 40% died. Of the 1,561 infections, some sporadic detection with associated travel to China has been detected in other countries. Whereas human-to-human transmission is rare, and there has been no evidence of sustained transmission between humans, vigilance in the detection and testing of these viruses is critical to monitor changes in the virus that could make populations within and outside of China at risk for infection. Since the emergence of A (H7N9) virus, human infections of avian influenza</p>    <p>A (H5N6), A (H10N8) and A (H6N1) viruses have also been detected and reported in China. Supporting China CDC in their efforts to monitor, detect, control, and prevent infections in humans is critical to preventing the worldwide spread of A (H7N9) and other novel influenza viruses currently circulating in China. The continued detection of novel viruses in China, coupled with the possibility of genetic mutations, or re-assortment with constantly circulating human influenza A viruses, underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and the development of an evidence-base for best practices related to novel influenza virus detection, preparedness, response, and mitigation within the country. In Asia, China is uniquely positioned to conduct implementation research to assess risks associated from seasonal and novel influenza viruses and to evaluate the benefit and effectiveness of influenza vaccination and other prevention strategies in vulnerable populations. China CDC houses a WHO-designated National Influenza Center and also serves as a WHO Collaborating Center for Influenza. The China CDC National Influenza Center regularly performs WHO and CDC proficiency panels, shares viruses with international WHO Collaborating Centers for Influenza and the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, and has the capacity to rapidly identify novel viruses such as, but not limited to, influenza A (H5N1) and A (H7N9) viruses. China CDC has also published guidelines on seasonal influenza vaccination among high risk groups. Recommended target groups for influenza vaccination in China follow the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) recommendations for influenza vaccine and include: pregnant women, young children, the elderly, healthcare workers and persons with chronic diseases. Despite an existing influenza vaccination policy, influenza vaccination coverage remains at less than 2% for most target groups. This demonstrates the need for additional data to support increased vaccine supply and uptake.</p>    <p>Seasonal influenza vaccine coverage is higher in some municipalities and regions of China that have local policies for vaccinating certain at-risk populations. In Beijing, for example, annual seasonal influenza vaccination is offered free of charge to adults aged 60 years and older and to school children. Coverage in these high risk groups approaches 50% in Beijing. Having a system in place for seasonal vaccination will facilitate use of a pandemic vaccine, if and when it is needed. China is also one of the few middle-income countries with several local vaccine manufacturers who are currently developing pandemic influenza vaccines. In 2015, one of China&rsquo;s local biological manufacturers became the first to produce a WHO pre-qualified seasonal influenza vaccine. This allowed the donation of influenza vaccine from China to several resourcepoor countries.</p>    <p>CDC&rsquo;s Influenza Division has collaborated with China CDC for more than 20 years. Activities include conducting influenza surveillance to better understand influenza seasonality, determining risk factors for severe disease, evaluating risk factors for transmission of novel influenza viruses at the animal-human interface, and estimating morbidity and mortality attributable to influenza virus infections. However, information on risk of influenza, and effectiveness of influenza vaccination and other prevention measures in vulnerable populations (e.g., pregnant women, persons with underlying medical conditions, the elderly, infants, and healthcare workers), is still limited. In addition, few data are available on the epidemiology and risk of infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. Addressing these gaps will inform global assessment of the risk posed by novel&nbsp; influenza viruses with pandemic potential and decisions about the need for influenza vaccine development, procurement, and stockpiling for target groups. Enhanced surveillance, program evaluation and research, conducted as part of this cooperative agreement, will seek to fill these gaps in our understanding of seasonal and novel influenza epidemiology in Asia.</p>"12437,Grant,"Reinforcing Public Health System to Prevent, Detect and Respond to Public Health Threats <p><strong>Background</strong></p>    <p>Overview In March 2014, the largest Ebola virus outbreak on record erupted in West Africa. Unlike many smaller preceding outbreaks of Ebola virus, this particular outbreak spread to multiple African countries and caused over 25,000 cases and over 10,000 deaths. The outbreak revealed the urgent need for African countries to strengthen their public health capacities and to comply with the International Health Regulations (IHR) guidelines. Countries in Africa and around the world saw cases due to the highly mobile nature of the world. The Ebola epidemic reinforced the lessons of previous pandemics, including SARS and H1N1 influenza, specifically; i) in the modern world of travel, trade, and migration, infectious diseases rapidly cross geopolitical boundaries; ii) strong public health systems are necessary to attain global health security; iii) There is urgent need to build and strengthen the capacity of African countries to prevent, detect and respond to public health threats. Several countries in Africa have made important strides in improving population health and strengthening their public health systems. With the aftermath of the Millennium Development Goals and now the current implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, countries have committed to assuring the health of their people. For example, although important health indicators, such as under five mortality, infant mortality, and maternal mortality, are still high in Africa, countries have recorded progress in bringing down these rates. Challenges with systems, institutions, and workforces limit the ability of many countries in Africa to execute essential public health functions, including: surveillance, emergency monitoring and response, disease prevention, health promotion, governance, public health workforce development, sustainable financing, and public health research. These functions are essential to prevent, detect, and respond to endemic diseases and diseases of epidemic potential. Additional threats to the health of Africa, and ultimately the world, include a rising burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), injury, and environmental disasters. This NOFO is designed to build and strengthen capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to public health emergencies of regional and international concern in Africa, to evaluate, analyze, and address priority public health problems in Africa, and to support policies and programs that prevent disease and promote health, including surveillance, laboratory systems, information systems, emergency response capacity, public health research, and workforce development.</p>"14036,Grant,"Empowering Women Living with HIV for Solidarity and Secure Livelihoods <p><strong>Opportunity Background</strong></p>    <p><strong> About UN Women </strong></p>    <p>UN Women&rsquo;s vision is of a world in which women and men have equal opportunities and capacities, where all women are empowered and where principles of gender equality and women&rsquo;s human rights are firmly embedded in all efforts to advance development, peace and security.

This collaboration has helped build the public health system in China, address health issues of importance to both countries, and build a strong relationship between the US and China on public health. However, as China&rsquo;s capacity, health status, and global role grow, the nature of the collaboration is evolving from one of assistance to one of partnership. Nonetheless, China still needs specialized technical support to continue developing its public health system while also contributing to improving public health globally. A disease threat anywhere is a disease threat everywhere; moreover, disease outbreaks can devastate economies, destabilize political environments, and impact national security. China is at special risk for outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging infections, in part because its large population of both people and livestock result in significant human-animal interface and increased spread of zoonotic disease. China has the 3rd highest burden of tuberculosis (TB) globally and increasing antibiotic resistance. Moreover, China is linked to the world through expanding trade and air travel, increasing the risk for infections spreading from China to the US and the rest of the world. Thus, it is in the interest of both the US and China to collaborate to reduce the threat of infectious diseases in China that have potential for spread globally. CDC has been partnering with China to build China&rsquo;s public health capacity&mdash;strengthening public health surveillance, preventing disease transmission, and improving laboratory detection of infectious diseases, such as influenza, acute respiratory infections, food-borne infections, vaccine-preventable diseases, HIV, and drug-resistant TB. CDC has supported the Chinese Field Epidemiology Training Program to strengthen disease surveillance, epidemiology, and capacity to respond to infectious disease and other public health emergencies in China and to develop future public health leaders. CDC has advised China on science-based communication strategies to mitigate public health threats and address public health priorities. Whereas these efforts have greatly strengthened China&rsquo;s public health capacity, advanced technical support is needed to help China continue to develop into a global public health leader.<br />Since most of the world remains under-prepared to effectively prevent, detect, and respond to disease threats, helping China build its capacity to assist other countries benefits the US, China, and the world. In response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, China demonstrated its growing capacity to improve public health systems in other countries. This shift has resulted in China and US commitments to close collaboration on global health, such as jointly supporting Africa CDC, and helping China continue to build capacity in global health.</p>    <p>In 2017, the Presidents of US and China agreed to carry out joint activities to control infectious diseases. Continuing close relationships between the US and China built through decades of public health collaboration provide a foundation essential to work together to respond to future global pandemics and other public health emergencies that threaten Americans at home and abroad. The purpose of this cooperative agreement is for CDC to continue to collaborate with China to reduce the threat of infectious diseases in China and around the world, which in turn contributes to the common defense of both countries against health threats.</p>"11679,Grant,"Coordinating Center for the Consortium of Translational Research in Early Detection of Liver Cancer     <div class=""heading4""><strong><a name=""_Toc258873267""></a>Purpose</strong></div>    <p>The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to establish a Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC).

Worldwide, liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death, and it is a rising cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States (U.S.) The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is three times higher in men than women, and there are racial and ethnic differences in liver cancer occurrence. The liver cancer burden is higher in African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. The etiological/risk factors for liver cancer include viral hepatitis (Hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis C virus), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Approximately 80-90% of HCC occurs in patients with underlying liver cirrhosis. In patients with cirrhosis, the 5-year cumulative risk of liver cancer ranges from 5-30%, depending on the etiology, and patients with advanced cirrhosis represent a high-risk group for liver cancer and are recommended for surveillance.</p>    <p><em>Hepatitis B/C viruses in liver cancer.</em>&nbsp;Viral hepatitis is a major etiologic factor for liver cancer in the U.S. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects approximately 1% of the U.S. population and approximately 50-60% of the patients with HCC are infected with HCV. Direct acting antivirals are successful in the treatment of chronic HCV infections but the risk of developing HCC is not completely eliminated. Globally, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the most frequent underlying cause of liver cancer. In the United States, approximately 20% of the HCC cases are attributable to HBV. There is a need for effective surveillance, early detection, and improved screening technologies for HBV-associated liver cancer.</p>    <p><em>Non-viral liver pathologies reflecting increased risk for liver cancer.</em>&nbsp;It is estimated that currently 25% of the U.S. population has NAFLD (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) which can progress to NASH. Cirrhosis can develop in patients with NASH resulting in an increased risk for HCC. Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a burden in Western countries and is rising worldwide. Heavy alcohol abuse results in liver cirrhosis which greatly increases the risk for liver cancer. With the increase in obesity and metabolic syndrome, there is greater prevalence of these underlying liver diseases in the U.S. population and in future more HCC may be attributable to NASH.</p>    <p><em>Need for early detection of liver cancers.&nbsp;</em>The prognosis of patients with HCC largely depends on the tumor stage at the time of diagnosis. If detected early, liver cancer patients can undergo transplantation or resection and achieve 5-year survival of 70%. In contrast, patients with advanced stage HCC are only eligible for palliative treatments and have a median survival of less than one year. Unfortunately, current surveillance protocols do not detect many HCCs until they are late stage. In the U.S. and Europe, surveillance guidelines for patients with cirrhosis is hepatic ultrasound every 6 months. Ultrasound has a sensitivity of approximately 60% for early stage HCC and a specificity of approximately 85-90%. The performance of ultrasound is operator dependent, which reduces its reproducibility, and is less accurate in obese patients. Improved biomarkers and imaging methods are needed that can enhance surveillance, better stratify patients, and increase the fraction of HCC detected at an early stage.</p>    <p><em>Challenges and opportunities in HCC research.&nbsp;</em>The following aspects reflect major unmet clinical needs related to HCC and should be viewed as high priority areas for translational research.</p>    <ul>    <li>Current biomarkers for HCC surveillance and/or early detection lack adequate sensitivity and specificity. Validation/verification studies that combine biomarkers, utilize clinical parameters, and/or include imaging modalities in cohorts of patients with cirrhosis are needed to improve the surveillance and increase the detectability of early-stage HCC.</li>    <li>Access to large cohorts of patients with cirrhosis attributable to viral hepatitis [HBV or HCV], NASH, or ALD is a challenge that needs to be addressed to identify biomarkers and clinical parameters associated with the different etiologies for the early detection of HCC in these patients.</li>    <li>Given the high prevalence of cirrhosis, it is important to understand the risk of progression to HCC in cirrhotic patients. The identification and stratification of patients with cirrhosis, who are at a particularly high risk for progression to HCC, is likely to result in considerable clinical benefits.</li>    <li>The liver cancer burden is higher in minority populations, i.e. African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. The performance of biomarkers in different racial and ethnic populations needs to be better understood.</li>    </ul>    <p>All these aspects need to be studied to achieve progress in HCC early detection and, ultimately, increase the survival of HCC patients.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Specific Objectives and Requirements</strong></div>    <p><strong>The Overall Research Goals of the Consortium and the Roles of Its Parts</strong></p>    <p>The Consortium will be focused on advancing three main areas relevant to early detection of liver cancers:</p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent""><strong><em>Area 1:</em></strong>&nbsp;Improving the surveillance for liver cancers in patients with cirrhosis;</p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent""><strong><em>Area 2:&nbsp;</em></strong>Increasing the detectability of liver cancers at early stages; and/or</p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent""><strong><em>Area 3:&nbsp;</em></strong>Approaches to better stratify patients with cirrhosis, who are at risk of developing liver cancer.</p>    <p>Research efforts in all three areas are expected to include strong emphasis on biomarker-based approaches (specifically, biomarker development and validation phases) as a prominent element of all studies.&nbsp;</p>    <p>These research efforts will be the primary responsibility of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Translational Research Centers&nbsp;</em></strong>conducting individual research projects involving biomarker validation (with the focus on phases 2-3 of the process defined at&nbsp;<a href=""https://edrn.nci.nih.gov/docs/EDRN5.pdf"">https://edrn.nci.nih.gov/docs/EDRN5.pdf</a>), collecting biospecimens, and engaging in trans-Consortium activities.</p>    <p>The role of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Data Management and Coordination Center</em></strong>&nbsp;will be to support and facilitate TRCs in their efforts as well as perform trans-Consortium integrating functions.&nbsp;Therefore, it is essential that the DMCC applicants are fully familiar with the companion FOA, RFA-CA-17-025, including the specific goals and requirements for the TRCs and other vital details of their functioning within the Consortium.</p>    <p><strong>Main roles and responsibilities expected for DMCC include, but are not limited to:</strong></p>    <p><strong>1.

The system has not changed much in the 25 years since independence, with the exception of incremental changes in decentralization and delegation of limited functional and managerial powers to the 27 regions.</p>  <p>According to the State Statistics Service of Ukraine, the average life expectancy in Ukraine in 2015 was 71.1 years (76.2 for women and 66.3 for men), well below the European Union average of 84 years for women and 79 years for men. Non-communicable diseases (mostly cardiovascular diseases and cancers) and injuries are the leading causes of death and disability. Nevertheless, Ukraine also suffers from a concomitant burden of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. Ukraine also has one of the highest DR TB rates in Europe. Child routine immunization coverage rates are significantly below both average European figures and world figures largely due to misbeliefs and myths about the harms of vaccination, in many instances cultivated by medical personnel. The Maternal Mortality Ratio has steadily declined after a rapid spike in the early 1990s and has stagnated at the level of 24 for the last several years, which is about three times higher than the European average. The Infant Mortality Rate, at the level of 8, is twice as high as in the European Union. Ukraine has 3.5 physicians per 1000 population &ndash; equivalent to the average in the European Union.</p>  <p>Oblast (regional) Health Departments are functionally subordinate to the Ministry of Health (MOH). At the same time they are accountable to the regional governments. The public funds for health, collected through general taxation (value added tax, income tax, customs fees, excise tax, etc), are allocated to an extensive network of publicly owned health facilities based on their existing infrastructure (number of hospital beds, staff, and building size). Such an input-based, line-item financing system bears inefficiencies in itself. There are few incentives for rationalizing use of resources or controlling funds allocated for health care services. Hence, Ukraine is the fourth country in the world for the number of hospital beds per population: there are 879 hospital beds per 100,000 people. The average length of hospital stay is 11.8 days, compared to seven days as the Eu</p>  <p>With only a few exceptions, hospitals are outdated, poorly maintained and equipped. Low patient turnout in many facilities results in poor quality of services and potential harm to patients. In addition to the extensive network of the MOH affiliated health care services, Ukraine also retains parallel health service delivery systems belonging to railroads system, military, Ministry of Infrastructure, maritime, Interior Ministry, and the penitentiary system. These parallel systems account for more than one tenth of total public expenditure on health, and about 9% of total hospital beds.</p>  <p>Total health spending in Ukraine constituted 7.4% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2014, with only 46% of it coming from public sources. According to the Article 49 of the Constitution of Ukraine, all Ukrainian citizens are entitled to a comprehensive guaranteed package of health care services provided free of charge at the point of use. However, this constitutional commitment is not backed by the available public financing of health.</p>  <p>Out of pocket payments, mostly for medicines and informal fees for health services, are a serious deterring factor for timely care-seeking by patients. According to estimates, about half of health care expenses are paid from patients&rsquo; pockets. Nine out of every ten Ukrainians have a fear of financial hardship in case of an episode of illness. So called &ldquo;Charity Funds,&rdquo; existing at many hospitals and clinics, are semi-formal methods of requiring patients to pay for health services. Formal salaries of medical personnel are at or below the subsistence level. Clinics primarily use the funds accumulated through the &ldquo;charity funds&rdquo; for supplementing salaries of medical personnel, and sometimes for upgrading the infrastructure and equipment of the hospitals. According to some health sector experts, doctors often have to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; their position: despite the physician&rsquo;s formal salary averaging only $200/month, some of the positions cost $10,000 to $25,000.</p>; <p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT AND PURPOSE</strong></p>  <p>This activity will address pervasive corruption in the health sector. This corruption results in the loss of a significant portion of limited health care resources and ultimately contributes to poor health outcomes.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Corruption in Ukraine&rsquo;s health sector has many faces. It includes high informal out-of-pocket payments for health services, deterring patients from seeking care in a timely manner. It is persistent vertical public financing of subventions for health services, channeled from the center to Oblast Healthcare Departments and then to hospitals and clinics. It is health workers facing corruption through their entire career, starting from being asked to pay bribes for interim exams in medical school and thereafter &ldquo;buying&rdquo; positions with a symbolic official payroll from a hospital chief doctor; charging patients informal fees to make up for the investment; prescribing brand name drugs that a patient doesn&rsquo;t need to receive a kickback from pharmaceutical companies; and paying a tuition fee for the post-diploma qualification course that a doctor will never attend, but will receive a certificate in order to reach the next, higher attestation level.</p>  <p>The first and most important victims of the current situation are patients, required to &ldquo;contribute&rdquo; to semi-formal hospital &ldquo;charity funds&rdquo;, asked to buy and bring necessary drugs and materials into the hospital for a surgery, while still receiving substandard care from a run-down facility with obsolete medical equipment and unhappy medical personnel.</p>  <p>Therefore, the goal of this activity is to support a transparent, accountable, and effective health care system that is capable of meeting the health needs of the Ukrainian people. Advancing health sector reforms, tackling corruption, and enhancing transparency will improve access to and availability of high quality health care services for Ukrainians, while boosting the health system as a significant sector of Ukraine&rsquo;s economy.</p>  <p><strong>PROJECT PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p>  <p>The Purpose of the activity is to support a transparent, accountable, and effective health care system that is capable of meeting the health needs of the Ukrainian people.

Elimination of corruption is a crosscutting theme across all six objectives to be achieved by this activity, which include:</p>  <p>1 Improving health sector governance through strengthening the MOH leadership and stewardship function.</p>  <p>2 Implementing the new health care financing model that drives efficiency, competition and choice.</p>  <p>3 Strengthening the health workforce.</p>  <p>4 Enhancing transparency, accountability and responsiveness of the health care system.</p>  <p>5 Strengthening support for health reform efforts through strategically planned, effective and targeted information and communication.</p>  <p>6 Improving service delivery system at all levels.</p>  <p><strong>COMPONENTS:</strong></p>  <p><em>Component 1</em>: Improving health sector governance and stewardship will focus on strengthening of the MOH role and technical capabilities to lead the ongoing reforms, as well as supporting the institutional strengthening of the newly formed NHS.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em>Component 2:</em> Implementing the new health care financing model will focus on introduction of the new payment methods that will drive efficiency, competition and choice, and will allow for procurement of services from non-public providers</p>  <p><em>Component 3:</em> Strengthening the health workforce will focus on improving health workforce planning, training, and streamlining the regulatory framework.</p>  <p><em>Component 4:</em> Enhancing transparency, accountability and responsiveness of the health care system will focus on designing the systems and mechanisms, which ensure that real-time, reliable health and administrative data is available for the MOH and other interested parties; that transactions between different players of the health care market are transparent and the amount of covert deals is dramatically reduced; that civil society and watchdog organizations are empowered to monitor the reforms process; and patients are empowered to exercise their health care rights and entitlements.</p>  <p><em>Component 5:</em> Strategically planned, effective and targeted information and communication campaign will increase the likelihood of successful reform implementation through increasing health sector transformation support by various stakeholders, including medical professionals, general public, patient groups, politicians, media, and others.</p>  <p><em>Component 6:</em> Improving service delivery system at all levels will focus on enhancing competition and choice in health care to improve patient satisfaction through better quality of services.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>"266991,Tender,"Coordinating Center for Heart Study; ; ; <p><strong>Jackson Heart Study</strong></p>    <p>The goal of this acquisition is to provide a Coordinating Center to continue to maximize the use of data and samples amassed on the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) cohort and to address new questions about the development and progression of clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) and related conditions.</p>    <p>The scientific objectives are to:</p>    <p>(1)investigate factors that account for the high burden of CVD in African- Americans, with specific focus on factors related to ventricular dysfunction and heart failure and impaired cognitive function; and</p>    <p>(2) improve statistical power for further risk prediction and hypothesis testing, particularly in informative subgroups.</p>    <p>The operational goals are to:</p>    <p>(1) continue to foster scientific collaborations; work collaboratively to</p>    <p>(2) provide cohort follow-up and clinical events ascertainment activities;</p>    <p>(3) conduct a clinic examination of the JHS participants;</p>    <p>(4) promote cardiovascular health in the local community; and</p>    <p>(5) encourage underrepresented minority students to pursue biomedical careers.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>"285341,Tender,"Consultancy Services for an Assessment of Integrated Child Well-Being Intervention; ; <div class=""reportRow"">&nbsp;</div>    <div class=""reportRow"">Type of notice:&nbsp;Request for proposal<br />Registration level<br />Title:&nbsp;A Three-year Pragmatic Assessment of an Integrated Child-wellbeing Intervention in Aceh Province, Indonesia<br />UN organization:&nbsp;United Nations Children's Fund<br />Reference:&nbsp;LRPS-2018-9138929<br />Published:&nbsp;11-Apr-2018<br />Deadline:&nbsp;24-Apr-2018 17:00<br />Time zone:&nbsp;(GMT 7.00) Bangkok, Hanoi, Jakarta&nbsp;</div>; <p>Indonesia&rsquo;s children face a range of deprivations and vulnerabilities such as poverty and inequality; home environments that are not sufficiently nurturing and supportive; and lack of access to essential interventions including health, nutrition and water and sanitation (WASH). These combine to negatively affect children&rsquo;s growth and development, and their prospects for a better future.</p>    <p>UNICEF Indonesia, in partnership with the Government, is launching an ambitious 3-year program in 8 districts of Aceh Province (4 high-intensity and 4 learning districts) to intensify, coordinate and potentially scale the delivery of child-wellbeing interventions across multiple sectors. Among Aceh&rsquo;s population of nearly 5 million, there are roughly 493,000 children under 5. Over 2/3 of these children grow up poor; 41% are chronically malnourished; nearly half are not fully immunized; and one-fifth live in households that practice open defecation.</p>    <p>To address these vulnerabilities UNICEF is working with the Government of Indonesia on a cross-sectoral approach to improving child-wellbeing. The approach has the following components*:</p>    <ul>    <li>Improve access to essential health, hygiene and nutrition services. Within each sub-village in Aceh a network of child health posts known as Posyandus are already established. This network is staffed by local volunteers and supported by professional staff from nearby clinics to provide preventive and promotive health and nutrition services, including growth monitoring, immunization, disease screening and basic nutrition/hygiene education. UNICEF will work with the Government to enhance service delivery through political advocacy with district leadership; revitalize coordination mechanisms; support for training of community health workers and health facility staff; with ongoing supervision, monitoring and feedback. Note that the posyandu network is a well-established national program. Advances in service delivery have substantial potential for replication and scale.</li>    <li>Enhance nurturing parenting relationships between caregivers and children. Drawing upon international good practice as well as lessons learned from experience in Indonesia, the health post/posyandu network will also be an entry point for the delivery of a parenting intervention. A curriculum will be designed for parents and caregivers to reinforce the technical content of health, hygiene and nutrition messages and improve parents&rsquo; understanding the importance of providing an overall protective environment for children within the home for children to survive and thrive</li>    </ul>    <p>This Terms of Reference outlines a scope of work for an Institution to lead a mixed-methods process evaluation to assess the overall effects of the approach. A pragmatic operational design for the assessment should document the feasibility; acceptability; coverage; effectiveness and scale/replicability of the approach and intervention

Although it is Africas largest economy, its most populous country and largest democracy, and a major oil exporter, Nigeria must overcome daunting development challenges if it is to fulfill its significant potential. Today, nearly 65 percent of Nigerians live in extreme poverty. If current trends continue, the country is on    course to surpass China and India by 2030 as the country with the highest number of people living in extreme poverty. Already, Nigeria has the highest number of out-of-school children-- and those Nigerian children who do attend school have learning outcomes that are among the worst in the world. </p>        <p> In its 2015-2019 Integrated Country Strategy, the U.S. Government Mission in Nigeria identified four priority goals _ improving governance, furthering economic development, enhancing stability, and expanding opportunity. In support of that vision, the USAID Mission has established its Country Development Cooperation Strategy goal as Reduced Extreme Poverty in a More Stable, Democratic Nigeria. </p>        <p> USAID/Nigeria developed this strategy based upon the assumption that its bi-lateral budgetary allocation is likely to continue to be heavily weighted toward addressing HIV/AIDS and other health challenges, including malaria, maternal and child health, and tuberculosis. With human lives in peril today, such priorities are urgent and compelling. However, this focus on the health issues facing Nigeria will leave a relatively modest resource pool to address the other key development challenges facing Nigeria. Given the    size of Nigerias population, any and all USAID investments must be highly targeted and applied in a manner that addresses the political factors inhibiting development and poverty reduction in this country. This being the case, USAID/Nigerias program will focus on governance concerns across the system to improve public service delivery, even while continuing to provide services    that directly save lives. </p>        <p>The goal will be pursued through three Development Objectives (DOs):</p>        <p>- DO 1: Broadened and inclusive growth</p>    <p>- DO 2: A healthier, more educated population in targeted states</p>    <p>- DO 3: Strengthened good governance</p>        <p>The USAID Mission has established its Country Development Cooperation Strategy goal as Reduced Extreme Poverty in a More Stable, Democratic Nigeria.

The ongoing demographic transition has provided a window of opportunity for strategic investments to maximize the potential demographic dividend. The total fertility rate has decreased significantly (from 4.2 in 1991 to 2.7 by 2011), leading to a growing working-age population, while the dependency ratio has declined (from 110 in 1981 to 60.2 in 2011). The country is experiencing the middle-income paradox of high economic growth combined with pockets of poverty and high income inequality. Botswana suffers from    severe prolonged drought, and women and girls are among the most vulnerable and the most affected by poverty and inequality (Gini coefficient of 0.61). Over one third (34 per cent) of young people aged 20-24 years and one fifth of the women are unemployed. Women, especially girls, are forced to find alternative ways to earn a living, making them susceptible to sexual abuse, gender-based violence, exploitation and unplanned pregnancies. Targeted investments are required to mitigate these challenges and to build the resilience of women and girls. </p>        <p>he programme proposes a shift in strategic engagement that recognizes the capacity of Botswana as an upper-middle-income country. The programme will therefore provide catalytic support to spur national scale-up, and pilot high-impact cost-effective interventions in selected districts to demonstrate effectiveness and inform policy and programming.

NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. Candidates should review the different career development (K) award programs, to determine the best program to support their goals.More information about Career programs may be found at the&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=41159"">NIH Extramural Training Mechanisms</a>&nbsp;website.</p>    <p>The objective of the NIAID Physician-Scientist Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) is to help address the current shortage of physicians who conduct biomedical research by offering this career development opportunity. Physician-scientists who see patients and perform medical research are ideally positioned to translate laboratory findings about disease mechanisms into clinical interventions that improve patient outcomes. This program supports outstanding eligible postdoctoral researchers who complete mentored training and transition in a timely manner to independent, tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions. The NIAID Physician-Scientists (PS) K99/R00 award is intended to foster the development of a creative, independent research program that will be competitive for subsequent independent funding and that will help advance the mission of NIAID. Applicants must have no more than 4 years of postdoctoral research experience at the time of the initial or the subsequent resubmission or revision application. This program is intended for individuals who require at least 12 months and up to 24 months of mentored research training and career development (K99 phase) before transitioning to the R00 award phase of the program for up to 24 months. Consequently, the strongest applicants will require, and will propose, a well-conceived plan for 1&ndash;2 years of substantive mentored research training and career development that will prepare them to become competitive candidates for tenure-track faculty positions and to launch robust, independent research programs.&nbsp;<em>An individual who cannot provide a compelling rationale for at least one year of additional mentored research training at the time of award is not a strong candidate for this award.</em></p>    <p><em>Individuals must be in mentored, postdoctoral training positions to be eligible to apply. If an applicant achieves independence (any faculty or non-mentored research position) before a K99 award is made, neither the K99, nor the R00 award, will be made.</em></p>    <p>The NIAID PS K99/R00 award will provide up to 4 years of support in two phases. The initial (K99) phase will provide support for up to 2 years of mentored postdoctoral research training and career development. In the second (R00) phase, NIAID will provide up to 2 years of independent research support, which is contingent on satisfactory progress during the K99 phase and an approved, independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty position. The two award phases are intended to be continuous in time. Therefore, although exceptions may be possible in limited circumstances, R00 awards will generally only be made to those K99 PDs/PIs who accept independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty positions by the end of the K99 award period.</p>    <p>For the purposes of this program, physician-scientists include individuals with an MD, DO, DDS/DMD, DVM/VMD, MD/PhD, DNP, or nurses with research doctoral degrees who devote the majority of their time to biomedical research. This K99/R00 is intended for those physician-scientists who already have substantial research training and are dedicated to initiating a strong, research-intensive career as physician-scientists. This program is designed to facilitate a timely transition of outstanding physician-scientists from mentored, research positions to independent, tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions, and to provide independent NIAID research support during the transition.

Despite the positive impact of genomic medicine on improving health outcomes as demonstrated by these studies, it has become clear that a major barrier to large-scale genomic medicine implementation is the lack of compelling clinical evidence that would convince clinicians to adopt promising strategies and medical insurers to pay for them.</p>    <p>The need for rigorous evaluation of the validity and utility of genomic medicine interventions and the best approaches for incorporating them in medical practice was highlighted in a recent National Academy of Medicine report which noted, &ldquo;the gold standard of clinical utility is the evaluation of results from prospective trials that have randomized subjects to genetic testing or no genetic testing in an effort to compare different genetically informed treatments with usual care or from genetically stratified trials that compare treatment outcomes between different genetic groups&rdquo; (<a href=""https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24632/an-evidence-framework-for-genetic-testing"">NAM, Evidence Framework for Genetic Testing, 2017</a>). Prospective trials demonstrating positive impact on important patient outcomes are widely viewed as providing the strongest evidence supporting clinical adoption, but are often expensive, lengthy, and cannot be conducted for every intervention or every genetic variant. In addition, traditional randomized clinical trials (RCTs) often fail to inform routine practice because they are designed to demonstrate efficacy or treatment impact in carefully selected participants with highly experienced investigators under ideal conditions, putting them at risk of over-estimating benefits and under-estimating harms. RCTs infrequently produce results that are easily translated to the real world, with at times dramatic decreases in effectiveness of a treatment when translated to routine clinical practice.</p>    <p>PCTs, in contrast, provide a more practical approach that is better integrated with routine clinical care. PCTs are designed from the start with input from healthcare providers, patients, and systems to produce practical evidence on improving outcomes of greatest value to these stakeholders. PCTs are designed to improve practice and policy, and unlike most traditional RCTs, take place in settings where routine care occurs, such as community clinics, primary care practices, hospitals, and pharmacies. They include diverse, representative populations in multiple, heterogeneous clinical care settings and compare selected interventions to real-world alternatives (rather than to placebo or no treatment). Assessing multiple outcomes is important not only to patients but also to clinical decision- and policy-makers. They employ flexible protocols that allow for customization to the characteristics and demands of local settings, and recruit diverse populations with broadly inclusive selection criteria and few exclusions. EHRs are closely integrated in study design and execution, allowing efficient and cost-effective identification and recruitment of patients, data collection, monitoring, and outcome assessment. Recognizing that traditional and pragmatic trials exist on a continuum, PCTs for IGNITE II will be selected to emphasize assessment of effectiveness (in routine settings) rather than efficacy (in ideal settings) and to produce results that will directly inform decision-making of healthcare providers, patients, administrators, and policymakers.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The IGNITE Network was funded in 2013 and 2014 (<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HG-12-006.html"">RFA-HG-12-006</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HG-12-007.html"">RFA-HG-12-007</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HG-13-004.html"">RFA-HG-13-004</a>), and has worked collaboratively to develop new methods for implementing genomic medicine in diverse clinical settings outside of specialized care and disseminated its findings to the genomic medicine community through its SPARK Toolbox and other means. In August 2016, NHGRI held the workshop entitled &ldquo;IGNITE and Beyond: The Future of Genome Medicine Implementation&rdquo; to identify optimal study designs for future genomic medicine implementation program(s). Key recommendations from this workshop include providing flexibility to follow-up single site study observations in genomic medicine implementation with expanded, large-scale studies to confirm findings and decrease bias; fostering collaboration between academic and community centers to increase access to genomic medicine in underrepresented and lower socioeconomic level populations; and partnering with stakeholders including payers and technology companies to get input on study design, conduct, and interpretation to provide the specific evidence needed for genomic medicine sustainability.</p>    <p>The objective of the IGNITE II program is to support a Network of multi-site CGs involving diverse settings and populations and a CC to conduct PCTs of genomic medicine interventions previously demonstrated to be feasible and of potential value in clinical care. Proposed trials will also include assessments of approaches for real-world applications and provide generalizable knowledge about when, how, and in what circumstances PCTs should be used in genomic medicine. Results of each trial will be compared to existing evidence from non-interventional studies to identify potential biases affecting the generalization of observational data to clinical practice in genomic medicine.</p>    <p class=""Heading4""><strong>Research Approach</strong></p>    <p>During the five-year project period, the IGNITE II Network will conduct 2-4 network-wide PCTs chosen from the protocols proposed by the funded CGs. The IGNITE II Protocol Review Committee (described below) will evaluate the PCT protocols proposed by each funded CG. Two to four protocols will then be selected based on clinical importance, feasibility of implementation in the funded CGs, potential impact, and cost, and the Steering Committee (SC) will adapt and expand each protocol to be implemented Network-wide utilizing the patient populations and multiple Clinical Sites comprising the funded CGs. Protocols conducted during the project period may be one of those proposed by the funded CG investigators or may be a modified or combined version of one or more proposed protocols. Protocols will be selected to maximize involvement of diverse Clinical Sites within the CGs, and may be modified during the protocol implementation and adaptation process with this end in mind. Note that for the purposes of this FOA, &ldquo;protocols&rdquo; refers to the PCTs proposed by each CG and ultimately selected for network-wide implementation.</p>    <p>Additionally, as the intent of IGNITE II is to inform clinical care and help create a new treatment paradigm that is readily translated to routine care, it is anticipated that protocols will be easily implemented in the course of patient care.</p>    <p>Additionally, as the intent of IGNITE II is to inform clinical care and help create a new treatment paradigm that is readily translated to routine care, it is anticipated that protocols will be easily implemented in the course of patient care. Similarly, IGNITE II encourages interoperability of processes, standards, best practices, and data across sites and with external healthcare systems as feasible. As common opportunities or best practices that apply across diseases and healthcare settings are identified, these opportunities will in turn contribute to broader efforts to build a shared evidence base for clinical decision-making, such as through the ClinGen Program (<a title=""Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"" href=""https://www.clinicalgenome.org/"">https://www.clinicalgenome.org/</a>), which aims to build an authoritative central resource that defines the clinical relevance of genes and variants for use in precision medicine and research, or the NIH All of Us Research Program (<a href=""https://allofus.nih.gov/"">https://allofus.nih.gov/</a>) which leverages advances in genomics, emerging methods for managing and analyzing large data sets while protecting privacy, and health information technology to accelerate biomedical discoveries.</p>    <p>An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), established by the NHGRI in accordance with NIH policies, will conduct interim reviews of trial data to monitor patient safety, and review study performance and overall progress.</p>    <p>The CC will have a dual coordination/support and research role in IGNITE II.

Africa accounts for 15-20% of the world&rsquo;s population and a disproportionately large share of disease burden, yet scientific publications by African researchers account for less than 2% of the total academic journal output. The challenge is therefore to enable African researchers to enhance their competitiveness for international funding opportunities early in their careers while retaining them in Africa, working on Africa&rsquo;s health challenges and priorities.</p>    <p>Capacity strengthening needs for health research in Africa have been documented by EDCTP, the World Bank and others. Lack of funding and systematic career development for researchers are two significant gaps. In general, health research capacity building programmes in Africa and other low-income regions are more tailored to PhD candidates than to early-career postdoctoral scientists. Furthermore, international fellowship programmes typically focus on people showing exceptional talent and promise. The experience of global health research funders is that Africans are under-represented and less competitive in their funding schemes: their science may be promising but the framing of research questions; the research design; the proposed analyses and mentoring are often not well developed.</p>    <p>The Africa Research Excellence Fund (AREF) aims to bridge the critical gap early in the career path from research experience to research leadership.

Research on e-cigarettes has become an area of great importance as e-cigarette popularity has seen high rates of growth in recent years. Rapid increases in use among youth highlight the need for understanding short- as well as long-term effects of e-cigarette aerosol inhalation. In addition, understanding the relative health impact of e-cigarettes compared to conventional cigarettes is particularly relevant information for individuals who plan to use e-cigarettes as a replacement for combusted tobacco products. Although it is well known that traditional cigarette use causes or exacerbates multiple cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, such as COPD and coronary heart disease, the health implications of e-cigarette use are largely unknown. Based on health effects of other inhalation exposures, likely organs to be affected by e-cigarettes include the heart and lung.&nbsp; This lack of data on harms or relative safety of e-cigarettes has made it exceptionally difficult for individuals, healthcare providers, regulating bodies, and other organizations to make informed decisions about e-cigarette use, guidance, and policy.</p>    <p>The components, mode of delivery, and use patterns of e-cigarettes are different from those of traditional cigarettes, and their cardiopulmonary effects also may be different.&nbsp; First, while there is evidence that carbon-based particles resulting from cigarette combustion are harmful to the heart and lung if inhaled, very little is known about effects of inhalation of the liquid-based particles e-cigarettes generate or even where they deposit in the lung. In addition, while the many flavoring chemicals used in e-cigarette liquids have been approved for human ingestion, the health effects of inhalation of heated components are unclear and potentially significant. For example, diacetyl, the flavoring component used in butter-flavored microwave popcorn and which is present in many e-liquids, is harmless if ingested but can cause a serious condition called obliterative bronchiolitis or &ldquo;popcorn lung&rdquo; if inhaled in significant quantities. Furthermore, the e-cigarette heating process itself drives chemical reactions in the e-liquid, so what the user inhales might significantly differ from what was purchased. Known toxins like acrolein and formaldehyde have been identified in e-cigarette aerosols. Finally, other dangers may result from inhalation of components not present in cigarette smoke, such as propylene glycol or metal contaminants. These could result in unexpected physiologic effects, possibly quite different from the effects caused by cigarette smoke.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Program Scope and Research Objectives</strong></p>    <p>The goal of this FOA is to form a foundational basis of research on the increasingly popular behavior of e-cigarette use, which may have significant health implications. The science of e-cigarettes and their potential health effects is in its infancy. Research will be required at all levels, from mechanistic studies to cohort and clinical investigations.&nbsp;</p>    <p>This FOA is intended to support research that investigates the physiologic or health effects of e-cigarette exposures on the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, alone or in combination. Proposed research should be relevant to products and constituents that are commercially available and to the inhalation of these products by individuals who use e-cigarettes. Studies involving clinical populations, animal models, and cell preparations are all permitted. Because nicotine is a constituent of many tobacco products in addition to e-cigarettes, applications solely devoted to investigating effects of nicotine will not be considered. However, nicotine may be one of several constituents or aerosol characteristics tested in a particular application. Research may examine the effects of the whole e-cigarette aerosol or of individual components or constituents. Research may examine where aerosols, components, or constituents deposit in the airways and the resulting heart and/or lung consequences. Research may also examine the heart or lung effects of e-cigarette use on at-risk populations such as those with pre-existing heart or lung disease.</p>    <p>This FOA is intended to support research teams comprised of investigators from multiple disciplines.

The<a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/6"">&nbsp;21st Century Cures Act</a>&nbsp;was signed into law in December 2016 dedicating new funds to support efforts associated with the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative/blue-ribbon-panel/blue-ribbon-panel-report-2016.pdf"">Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot<sup>SM</sup>&nbsp;Initiative</a>, including support for this FOA.</p>    <p>Recurrent translocations producing fusion oncoproteins are a hallmark of many childhood cancers and are pathognomonic of specific cancer types. These translocations generate fusions of normal proteins that become oncogenic, targeting developmental programs critical for transformation of the unique cell of origin for each cancer. Recent work suggests that pediatric fusion oncoproteins often work by deregulation of protein complexes that control gene expression or chromatin state. Fusion oncoproteins are well-defined cancer drivers that are often found in cancers with few other genetic lesions, and their continued expression is essential for cancer cell growth and/or survival. Therefore, they represent highly credentialed targets for potential therapeutic development. In practice, however, the search for effective inhibitors has been hampered both by the largely &ldquo;undruggable&rdquo; nature of transcription factors, as they lack distinct enzymatic pockets for tight small molecule binding, and by the lack of understanding of fusion oncoprotein function and of the multimeric protein complexes through which these proteins exert their effects.</p>    <p>To meet these challenges, the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative/blue-ribbon-panel/pediatric-cancer-working-group-report.pdf"">Blue Ribbon Panel Pediatric Cancer Working Group</a>&nbsp;recommended supporting research to enhance understanding of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of transformation driven by fusion oncoproteins, develop faithful models of these pediatric cancers, identify their key dependencies, and use this information to develop novel therapeutic approaches that target these cancers. To achieve these goals, the panel recommended forming a highly dynamic and collaborative network of investigators with unique perspectives and expertise in the areas of proteomics, structural biology, genomics/epigenomics, chemistry, experimental therapeutics, and disease-specific biology. This multidisciplinary approach to dissecting the molecular mechanisms of fusion oncoproteins will facilitate development of novel strategies for their therapeutic targeting.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Specific Requirements</strong></div>    <p>This FOA solicits applications for FusOnC2 Centers that take a comprehensive approach to understanding the biology of pediatric fusion oncoproteins and to developing targeted therapeutics. Each FusOnC2 Center will include diverse areas of expertise to facilitate progression from structure-function biochemical data to biological insight, to small molecule inhibition, and setting the stage for preclinical in vivo testing. Relevant areas of expertise that could be included are (among others) proteomics, structural biology, genomics/epigenomics, medicinal chemistry, experimental therapeutics, and cancer biology. Multi-institutional collaborations are strongly encouraged to achieve the breadth of expertise required for a comprehensive approach to understanding fusion protein mechanisms and therapeutic targeting.</p>    <p>This FOA focuses on fusion oncoproteins found in tumors that have high risk of treatment failure and for which there has been little progress in identifying targeted agents. Responsive applications must focus on one of the following fusion oncoproteins: EWSR1-FLI1 or related EWSR1 fusion oncoproteins (Ewing sarcoma); PAX-FOXO (alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma); SYT-SSX (synovial sarcoma); C11orf95&ndash;RELA (ependymoma); or NUP98 fusion proteins that occur in young children with AML. This list focuses on cancers for which there are no known effective targeted agents, and includes the most common fusion oncoproteins observed in pediatric solid tumors and brain tumors, as well as a high risk leukemia that is refractory to current treatment strategies.</p>    <p>Teams should select either a single fusion oncoprotein or a small family of related fusion oncoproteins for&nbsp;<em>comprehensive study that includes both investigation into biological mechanisms and development of targeted therapeutics</em>.</p>    <p><strong>Potential areas of investigation for the Research Projects include but are not limited to:</strong></p>    <ul>    <li>Development of model systems and approaches to interrogate the function of fusion oncoproteins in specific childhood cancers, including those from racial/ethnic minority and underserved groups, and to provide preclinical assessment of potential therapeutics.

More than one billion people - one-seventh of the world&rsquo;s population - suffer from one or more NTDs. Often the source of deep stigma, NTDs cause disability, severe disfigurement, and blindness. These diseases affect the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable populations with devastating, lifelong disabilities that contribute to ensnaring individuals, families, and even entire communities in poverty.</p>    <p>Seven of the most prevalent NTDs - lymphatic filariasis (LF), trachoma, schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, and the three soil-transmitted helminth infections (ascariasis, trichuriasis, and hookworm infection) - can be targeted through a highly effective integrated community treatment approach using freely-donated drugs that have been proven safe and effective, and can be delivered by trained non-health personnel. This approach, known as mass drug administration (MDA), provides a single dose medication to all eligible individuals in an affected community generally once or twice a year. When implemented without interruption over three to seven years, MDA can significantly control the burden of NTDs and in some cases, elimination can be achieved. USAID focuses on these &ldquo;preventive chemotherapy&rdquo; (PCT) diseases because of the readily available interventions and availability of drugs donated to countries for free by pharmaceutical companies.</p>    <p>Acknowledging the devastating effect of NTDs on vulnerable populations, six prominent pharmaceutical companies established drug donation programs to contribute to the global fight against NTDs. These donations can be accessed only if national NTD programs can demonstrate that they have a need for the drugs and the ability to distribute them to affected communities. USAID&rsquo;s Neglected Tropical Diseases Program was established in 2006 at the direction of Congress to 1) expand the provision of proven effective NTD interventions, such as mass drug administration, 2) leverage drug donation programs, and 3) integrate vertical programs to treat as many people as possible at the same time. The program was mandated to focus on NTDs that <br />&nbsp;can be addressed through mass drug administration and benefited from existing donation programs.</p>    <p>The combination of donated medicines from pharmaceutical companies and USAID&rsquo;s track record of successfully scaling up these NTD interventions, make the NTD program the Agency&rsquo;s largest private-public partnership. For every dollar that USAID invests, $26 worth of donated drugs is leveraged.</p>    <p>Investments in global health create pathways out of poverty. Preventing and controlling NTDs is central to ending extreme poverty within the next two decades. USAID&rsquo;s NTD Program supports the achievement of broader development goals, such as USAID&rsquo;s goals of ending extreme poverty and the WHO Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1 and 2 (&ldquo;to end poverty in all its forms&rdquo; and &ldquo;to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all, respectively), which includes ending NTDs by 2030. The control and elimination of NTDs primarily contributes to the Bureau for Global Health&rsquo;s third strategic objective, &ldquo;Protecting Communities from Infectious Diseases.&rdquo; Additionally, USAID&rsquo;s NTD Program supports the World Health Organization&rsquo;s NTD Roadmap, which established targets and milestones for the global control, elimination, and eradication of NTDs by 20201<br />.<br />The global impact of USAID&rsquo;s NTD program has been transformative. Over the last ten years, USAID has provided over 2 billion treatments to 936 million people and leveraged USD $15.7 billion in donated drugs from the private sector. Due to the program&rsquo;s focus on partnerships and integrated delivery platforms, it has achieved an average treatment cost of 63 cents per person or 29 cents per treatment. Additionally, USAID investments have accelerated the development and implementation of quality program tools, established best practices, and informed global policy, thus, setting the standard for national NTD programs worldwide.</p>    <p>At the start of the program, elimination of any of the diseases was not considered to be feasible in much of the world. Over the years, however, USAID&rsquo;s massive scale-up and commitment to quality have resulted in 198 million people living in communities no longer requiring treatment for LF and 84 million people living in communities no longer requiring treatment for trachoma. This success has demonstrated that elimination of LF and trachoma is indeed achievable. Additionally, the integrated approach has strengthened Ministry of Health programs for those diseases requiring longer-term control strategies (e.g., schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, and soiltransmitted helminthiasis) by raising the profile of all NTDs via more robust programs and preventing morbidity for millions more people.</p>    <p>The proposed program builds on more than a decade of USAID investments in controlling and eliminating NTDs. Since 2006, USAID has invested the greatest portion of its NTD funding in the following areas:</p>    <p> Mapping for seven targeted diseases across each country to determine disease prevalence and the required treatment regimens;<br /> Supporting countries to access pharmaceutical donation programs to provide essential treatments to all eligible populations through needs forecasting and the submission of drug applications;<br /> Supporting countries with planning, logistics, community awareness, and administration to provide integrated NTD treatment packages to at-risk communities for multiple NTDs;<br /> Conducting assessments, based on WHO guidelines, to measure the impact of treatment programs, thus, determining whether diseases are being controlled or eliminated as public health problems;<br /> Promoting political commitment by disease-endemic country governments to integrate formally vertical programs and build capacity for Ministry of Health staff to manage and operate those programs.</p>    <p>To achieve its congressional mandate, USAID established four-year stages/phases for the NTD program. Starting with a proof of concept stage in 2006, USAID&rsquo;s NTD Program proved that disease-specific vertical country programs could be integrated to address overlapping disease burdens in an effective and efficient manner. During those first four years, USAID provided targeted technical and programmatic support to enable countries to become eligible to receive and distribute donated drugs from pharmaceutical companies. The NTD program achieved unexpected success and was able to meet its five-year targets within three years. As the original beneficiary country programs achieved scale, the NTD program began its expansion stage. Between 2011 and 2015, USAID&rsquo;s NTD program expanded from 15 countries to 31 countries globally. Additionally, new tools and best practices were developed and disseminated in conjunction with the WHO. The progress also facilitated the increased investment of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Department for International Development (DFID) and private philanthropists. Currently, the NTD program is in an acceleration stage where maintaining coverage rates for mass drug administration, evaluating impact, and removing barriers for effective implementation are the core of current programming and where seventy percent of available resources are invested. By 2020, 70 percent of currently supported countries are projected to stop treatment for LF and trachoma. In future stages, the NTD program will redouble efforts to document country program successes by working with countries to verify and submit evidence of elimination to the WHO, develop strategies to bolster countries that are not on track to meet elimination goals, and collaborate with host-country governments to identify sustainable delivery platforms for diseases targeted for control.</p>    <p>To achieve the goals from each stage of the program, USAID has awarded four cooperative agreements and one grant for implementation support throughout its 10-year history. These assistance mechanisms have successfully achieved their goals in each program stage. Currently, the two active cooperative agreements, ENVISION and END in Africa, are on track to achieve their program goals supporting 26 countries globally. This program will continue to support the &nbsp;milestones under the acceleration stage and also embark on supporting the documentation and sustainability stage.</p>"11631,Grant,"Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network Data Coordinating Center; ; ; <p>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health through a limited competition is seeking applications to continue the Data Coordinating Center for the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (<a href=""http://dilin.org/"">DILIN</a>) established by NIDDK in 2003. The DILIN has made major advances in the study&nbsp;of the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of hepatotoxicity due to drugs and&nbsp;to herbal and dietary supplements (HDS). This RFA and a companion RFA-DK-17-509 will seek the continuation of the Data Coordinating Center and six Clinical Centers to enhance the enrollment of cases and controls (when justified) from a diverse demographic background and a wide geographic distribution. A major aim of the network study is to pursue genetic analyses to find predictive biomarkers as well as genetic &ldquo;fingerprints&rdquo; useful for elucidating the pathogenesis of Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) and ultimately for developing specific means of prevention and or treatment.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The Network will be composed of 6 Clinical Centers with expertise in diagnosis and management of DILI and a Data Coordinating Center with expertise in the management of multicenter studies and clinical and translational datasets.&nbsp; This RFA requests applications for a single Data Coordinating Center as a part of this limited competition. The Clinical Centers will be solicited through a separated RFA (RFA-DK-17-509).</p>    <p>The DILIN Data Coordinating Center is expected to build on the collaboration with the National Center for Natural Products Research (NCNPR), University of Mississippi to establish an analytical core at the NCNPR. The collaboration with the NCNPR will attempt the identification of specific hepatotoxic ingredients in HDS implicated in liver toxicity, using different approaches and targets, both agnostic and specific hepatotoxins through several phases.</p>    <p><strong>Background Information and Research Objectives</strong></p>    <p>Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the leading cause of acute liver failure in the US and the most common reason for US FDA regulatory actions regarding approved medications. Implicated drugs include not only prescription medications but also herbal products and over-the-counter dietary supplements and medications. Persons who develop hepatocellular DILI with jaundice have at least a 10% chance of dying from the injury and DILI patients that progress to acute liver failure have only a 25% chance of spontaneous recovery. While DILI caused by an agent can be serious, it is relatively uncommon, with an estimated frequency that ranges from 1 per 10?000 to 1 per 1?000?000 patient-years of exposure. Therefore, the low incidence of DILI coupled with the limited knowledge of the biochemical mechanism(s) or pathways responsible for this &lsquo;idiosyncratic&rsquo; adverse event make it difficult to identify high-risk patients. Furthermore, pre-clinical testing does not always provide a reliable assessment of the hepatotoxic risk of new medications, and because DILI is a rare event, pre-marketing clinical studies conducted in highly selected populations over a relatively short period of time also may not detect a potential for liver injury. Therefore, the hepatotoxicity of a specific medication often becomes apparent only after regulatory approval and when the drug is used by large numbers of unselected patients in the general population. Finally, the biochemical, clinical and histological features of DILI from initial onset to clinical presentation can not only mimic most other known forms of acute and chronic liver disease but can also vary substantially with a single agent. Thus, at present, there is no objective &lsquo;gold standard&rsquo; for diagnosing DILI and its identification largely relies on excluding other more common causes of liver disease and having a &lsquo;compatible&rsquo; time of onset and evolution. Drug-induced liver disease is challenging because of the ever-increasing number of drugs used in the management of diseases and the growing number of individuals who take medications.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Furthermore, the literature on drug-induced liver disease, often as short reports or letters to the editor whose validity is difficult to assess, is large and dispersed in many disciplines &ndash; including hepatology, gastroenterology, pharmacology, internal medicine, pediatrics, and surgery.&nbsp; For this reason, it is a challenge to keep abreast of the literature on drug-induced liver disease, and literature searches to specific medications are often incomplete.</p>    <p>For many of these reasons, the Liver Disease Research Branch of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Diseases in collaboration with the National Library of Medicine and the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network developed a web site dedicated to providing up-to-date, comprehensive clinical information on drug-induced liver disease for both the general physician and the subspecialist (<a href=""http://livertox.nih.gov/"">http://livertox.nih.gov/</a>).</p>    <p>It is noteworthy that since inception of the DILIN in 2003, the number of enrolled cases of Herbal and Dietary supplements (HDS) induced liver injury have steadily increased. HDS products now account for more than 20% of cases of DILI reported in DILIN.&nbsp; Furthermore, the liver injury from these products can be severe and lead to need for emergency liver transplant (in 13% of cases).</p>    <p>This FOA seeks to continue the DILIN Data Coordinating Center to provide the resources (analytical and managerial) to pursue the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network objectives in three main areas:</p>    <p>1) Clinical, biochemical, histologic and biologic characterization of DILI: Acute and chronic disease; HDS-induced, ethnic and racial differences, genetic studies, cytokines and immunological profiling.</p>    <p>These areas can be enhanced by seeking enrollment of cases (and controls when justified) from a wide demographic and geographic distribution. The network should make efforts to capture cases of DILI both from pediatric and adult's populations, and particularly from underrepresented minorities population from their sites and abroad by engaging minority investigators and pediatricians from academic and community clinical medical centers in the US willing to identify and capture cases of DILI, using an online case report system developed by the DILIN investigators, NIDDK.</p>    <p>Developing means of identifying and enrolling patients into DILIN at an early stage during drug-induced liver injury on whom accurate and complete clinical information combined with serially collected specimens of serum, plasma, urine, and liver tissue can be obtained, are essential to support mechanistic studies of the pathogenesis of the drug- or HDS-induced liver injury, in addition to genetic studies.</p>    <p>The continuation of the HDS repository of products associated with liver injury repository is an important tool to characterize the epidemiology, clinical presentation and outcomes of DILI and HDS-ILI. A better characterization of the chemical components of herbal mixtures and dietary supplements implicated in cases of liver injury may provide insights into the nature of the injury, suggest innovative approaches to mechanistic studies and ultimately provide means of prevention or treatment. The DILIN Data Coordinating Center will build on the collaboration with the National Center for Natural Products Research (NCNPR), University of Mississippi to establish an analytical core at the NCNPR. The collaboration with the NCNPR will attempt the identification of specific hepatotoxic ingredients in HDS implicated in liver toxicity, using different approaches and targets, both agnostic and specific hepatotoxins through several phases. &nbsp;The DILIN DCC will provide approaches for the use of Big Data Analytics to study, along with DILIN and NCNPR Investigators, the association between individual ingredients in HDS and patterns of liver injury.&nbsp; &ldquo;Big data&rdquo; is a term applied to data sets whose size is beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, manage, and process the data within a tolerable elapsed time. HDS compounds typically have multiple ingredients and ascertaining liver injury to one particular product has been a challenge. Moreover, patients consuming HDS products typically consume multiple products and further add to the complexity of causality assessment. Using Big Data analytics, a data driven approach will be pursued to pick up any signals related to a particular ingredient and its association with liver injury.</p>    <p>2) &nbsp;Pilot/feasibility studies that would lay the groundwork for future studies on treatment of severe DILI: Acute and symptomatic chronic cases. During the last grant cycle, the DILIN investigators have established the feasibility of enrolling acute DILI cases and obtaining serial biospecimens from them.&nbsp; These facts along with the significant morbidity attributed to DILI, with up to 20 % of subjects having continued liver injury 6 months after presentation, established the feasibility and need to explore studies that would lay the groundwork for future randomized controlled trials, possibly in life threatening acute and symptomatic chronic DILI cases.</p>    <p>3) Pharmacovigilance of HDS and newly approved prescription medications (collaboration with FDA) and public resource for accurate information on DILI (DILIN centers and Livertox).</p>    <p>Develop a computer-based, reliable instrument for the diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury that can be used broadly by the medical community.&nbsp; The instrument should be simple enough to be readily used, but detailed enough to provide an accurate assessment of the likelihood that the liver injury is due to the suspected medication, herbal or dietary supplement.&nbsp; The DILIN database of well characterized cases of drug-induced liver injury can be used to develop this diagnostic instrument and demonstrate its reliability (sensitivity, specificity) across a wide range of medications and types of injury.</p>    <p>As a public resource for accurate information on DILI, the DILIN centers will continue to expand and maintain Livertox (<a href=""http://livertox.nih.gov/"">http://livertox.nih.gov/</a>) as an authoritative, complete and updated internet web site for drug-induced liver injury.

Rare and yet-to-be described disorders are difficult problems for patients, their families, and their physicians. Patients and their family members will be referred to as participants in this FOA.</p>    <p>The goals of the UDN are to (1) improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases through the use of common protocols designed by a large community of investigators; (2) facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, by collecting and sharing standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures; and (3) promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple Clinical Sites and among laboratory and clinical investigators prepared to investigate the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms underpinning these difficult to diagnose diseases. Phase I (FY13-FY17) of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) extended the success of the NIH Intramural Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) to a network of UDN sites across the United States (<a href=""https://commonfund.nih.gov/Diseases/index"">https://commonfund.nih.gov/Diseases/index</a>). Phase I included seven Clinical Sites including the intramural NIH UDP, a Coordinating Center, and five Core Laboratories (Central Biorepository, Metabolomics Core, Model Organisms Screening Center, and two Sequencing Cores). There was also additional support provided for gene function research studies to complement the UDN. After a year of developing network-wide protocols, a single IRB, and an innovative Data Sharing and Use Agreement that allows for sharing of identifiable patient information with all members of the UDN, the UDN Gateway (<a title=""Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"" href=""https://undiagnosed.hms.harvard.edu/about/"">https://undiagnosed.hms.harvard.edu/about/</a>) started accepting applications in September 2015.

They were to follow a common protocol to allow for a coordinated, multi-disciplinary approach to meet the goals described above. The FOA also specified the creation of a central repository of data and biologic samples for subsequent hypothesis based research. It was envisioned that the information obtained from this prospective cohort study of chronic kidney disease would establish natural history and outcome measures for future intervention/prevention trials. It was also envisioned that the data and biosamples obtained would be available to the broader scientific community for retrospective analyses.</p>    <p>CKiD has succeeded in establishing a collaborative, multi-disciplinary consortium composed of pediatric nephrologists, cardiologists, psychologists, and epidemiologists.

The data collected has revealed novel information about the cohort of children being studied and informed the goals of this limited competition. Additionally, pilot clinical trials will be initiated shortly that build on the information gathered from CKiD (RFA-DK-16-018 and RFA-DK-16-035).

Alterations of peripheral immune function and central neuroimmune signaling have been linked to a broad spectrum of disorders, such as neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, degenerative diseases, addiction, pain, and obesity, as well as the aging process. Studies have shown that neuroimmune interactions are fundamental biological components of&nbsp;<a name=""_Hlk487643132""></a>CNS&nbsp;function and dysfunction. Multiple CNS-resident cell types, such as microglia and astrocytes, dynamically detect the brain environment, regulate neuronal activity and neurocircuit function, and mediate neuroinflammatory responses through diverse activity states. Neuroimmune signaling mediated by these cell types is hypothesized to play an essential role in homeostatic regulation of normal neuronal activities, but also to contribute to pathophysiological states in the CNS by exerting damaging or reparative effects. Thus, glia cells, neurovascular units, as well as other neuroimmune components in the CNS, act as partners to neurons to maintain normal brain function and respond to challenges; as such, their neuroimmune signaling may play a crucial role in disease initiation and progression.</p>    <p>Previous findings have markedly advanced our knowledge of neuroimmune interactions in normal CNS function, neurodevelopment, and diseases. However, there is a lack of understanding of how dynamic changes in the multiple neuroimmune components mediate transitions from normal brain function to the early stages of CNS disorders, how changes in immune signaling are integrated into neuronal networks, and how disease progression is orchestrated by multiple neuroimmune components. A better understanding of dynamic interactions of neuroimmune components and the temporal transition to the disease process will provide a window into the early onset and progression of CNS disorders, which are poorly understood. Recent technological advances such as, but not limited to, measuring real-time gene and protein production in native environments, monitoring diverse cell phenotypes/states and cell-cell interactions, circuit-based multiplex profiling, as well as in vivo imaging of molecular and cellular components, have provided an unprecedented opportunity to track dynamic activity changes and generate snap shots of disease onset and progression at the molecular, cellular, and circuitry levels.</p>    <p>The outcomes of this initiative will define the role of multiple neuroimmune components in the transition from normal to disordered CNS function, which is critical for understanding disease onset and progression. In addition, gene and protein expression profiling of the temporal transition will define the time course of biomarkers and thus facilitate the design of effective therapeutic strategies for optimal timing at which therapies should be delivered.</p>    <p>This FOA will consider experimental paradigms of CNS disorders across all temporal scales, from disease onset through progression. It encourages projects that combine diverse expertise and use innovative approaches to generate an integrative understanding of dynamic changes in multiple neuroimmune components, such as neurons, microglia, and astrocytes, leading to pathophysiology at the molecular, cellular and circuitry level.</p>    <p><strong>This initiative seeks applications in areas including, but not limited to:</strong></p>    <ul>    <li>Measuring of dynamic molecular and cellular activity changes in multiple neuroimmune components, such as neurons, microglia, and astrocytes, to define the role of each cell type in the transition from homeostatic interactions to disease onset and progression.</li>    <li>Examining how inflammatory signals, either arising within the CNS or the peripheral systems, alter the cross-talk among neuroimmune components, such as microglia, astrocytes, and neurons, and what their roles are in the dysregulation of specific neurocircuit function.</li>    <li>Determining of how the function of specific types of neurons or synapses are impacted by changes of neuroimmune signals or genetic alterations of neuroimmune components.</li>    <li>Examining how alterations of neuronal activity associated with diseases disrupt the homeostatic interactions of multiple neuroimmune components.</li>    <li>Examining how cell-type specific interference impacts the interaction of neuroimmune components and regulates the transition to pathophysiological CNS conditions.</li>    <li>Identifying molecular signatures of the critical time points at which alterations in neuroimmune interactions may promote or suppress disease onset or progression.</li>    </ul>    <p>The focus of the FOA is on the dynamic neuroimmune interactions of multiple cell types in the CNS, including those of the retina, and their roles in the transition from normal to disease conditions. Projects studying how peripheral conditions or environmental factors alter neuroimmune interactions in the CNS will also be considered. Projects should address temporal changes in multiple neuroimmune components, such as neurons and glia cells, neurovascular units, or other relevant neuroimmune components. Studies that focus on infectious diseases or the pathophysiological conditions that arise from infiltrating T cells or B cells in the CNS are not responsive to this FOA. Projects measuring only one or two cell types, or the endpoint of diseases without tracking dynamic changes during the disease process will not be considered responsive to this FOA.</p>    <p>Applicants are strongly encouraged to consult the Scientific/Research Contact listed below to discuss the alignment of their proposed work with the goal of this FOA.</p>"11691,Grant,"Alcoholic Hepatitis Clinical and Translational Network Data Coordinating Center; ; ; <div class=""heading4""><strong><a name=""_Toc258873267""></a>Background</strong></div>    <p><a name=""_Hlk482362853""></a>Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a clinical syndrome of acute liver failure prevalent in people with decades of heavy alcohol use, for which there are no effective treatments.

This goal is relevant to the recommendations on ""Discovering Diversity"" and ""Maps at Multiple Scales"", (Section III).</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives</strong></div>    <p>This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is designed to support development and validation of novel tools to facilitate the detailed analysis of brain microconnectivity.&nbsp;<a name=""_Hlk487038937""></a>The primary goal is to provide techniques and resources for understanding and delineating the structure of complex circuits at the level of synaptic connections, alone or in combination with methods for identifying important cellular and circuit features, for example, for classifying or characterizing cellular or synaptic phenotypes.&nbsp; Understanding and delineating complex circuits&nbsp;will provide insight into important cellular interactions that underlie brain function and ultimately complex behaviors. Defining cellular and circuit-level function is dependent on detailed knowledge about the components and structure of the circuit. Such knowledge, in turn, is fundamental to understanding how these features underlie cognition and behavior, which should aid in the development of targeted cell-type and circuit-specific therapeutics to treat brain disorders. This initiative is focused on developing and optimizing tools and resources to characterize the cells and connections within neuronal circuits.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Recent advances in electron microscopy (EM) and alternative techniques for nanoscale imaging have enabled major gains in the rate and quality of morphological and connectivity analysis of neurons and their embedded circuits. Some of these gains have come from ongoing EM efforts outside of NIH, including the HHMI Janelia Farm FlyEM project, the IARPA MICrONS project, and major efforts from the Max Planck Institute in Germany. In addition, newer techniques such as expansion microscopy and array tomography, and emerging methods for barcode-based tagging of synaptic connections, have advanced to the point they may be considered for the purposes of mapping brain connectivity with synapse resolution.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Despite these ongoing projects and the progress they have made, addressing the dramatic scale of mapping circuits at the level of the trillions of synapses in the brain, and the scope of the analytic challenges for interpreting their connectivity, requires concerted technical development towards true high-throughput microconnectomics. The goal of this proposed effort is to produce the necessary tools, including novel or refined techniques and new datasets, to bring microconnectivity analysis into routine use for interrogating healthy and diseased brains, in model organisms and humans. More broadly, the intention is to put within reach the ultimate challenge of understanding the circuit level substrates of brain activity.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Development of novel tools that will delineate anatomical connections between cells and expand our knowledge of circuit architecture and function is an area well poised for additional investment. Several efforts are currently underway to study large-scale, long-range connections, such as the NIH Human Connectome Project, as well as large scale rodent connectional studies. This FOA solicits applications to develop next-generation, innovative technologies for the analysis of the microconnectome.&nbsp; Traditional EM studies have provided our best understanding to date of synaptic connections but breakthroughs in additional imaging modalities hold promise for alternative approaches that can be implemented to deliver high quality connectional information at high throughput.</p>    <p>Tools/technologies relevant for this initiative are expected to be transformative, either through the development of novel tools that may be high-risk or through major advances in current approaches that break through technical barriers and will significantly improve current capabilities. While an emphasis of the BRAIN initiative is the development of novel tools to study the brain, here we highlight the need for innovative approaches to bridge experimental scales. Studies that are able to explore molecular and cellular mechanisms of neural activity permitting improved precision and sensitivity in the analysis of micro-and macro-circuits are strongly encouraged.

Ethiopia has a mixed-HIV epidemic with national prevalence of 1.1%. The prevalence within the Female Sex Worker (FSW) key population is 24%. Additionally, CDC Ethiopia has identified other priority populations whose prevalence is higher than national average. Currently, these priority populations include individuals who engage in sexual activity with FSWs, long distance truck drivers, uniformed services, never-married sexually active females, discordant couples, migrant laborers, and adolescent and young girls. In 2014, UNAIDS launched a 90-90-90 strategy to achieve a sustained epidemic control by 2020 and end the epidemic by 2030. Ethiopia is working to achieve these ambitious 90-90-90 targets by 2020 and targeting interventions on its key and propriety populations.</p>    <p>Currently, there are many types of organizations working on HIV prevention activities throughout Ethiopia. The specific response targeting Ethiopia&rsquo;s key and priority populations is not well coordinated. Poor coordination and standardization of activities is resulting in inefficiencies and redundancies throughout the system. At the service delivery level this results in disparate and inequitable service provision. This is further compromised when existing standards are not updated and improved based on program data.

Specifically, this initiative will support research on a) novel stigma reduction interventions that link to increase in care-seeking behavior and/or decrease in transmission; b) reducing the impact of stigma on adolescent and/or youth health; c) strategies to cope with the complex burden of stigmatization due to HIV and one or more co-morbidities/co-infections; d) reducing the effects of stigma on and/or by family members or caregivers of PLWH; and e) innovative and improved&nbsp; stigma measurement in the context of intervention development or implementation. The R21 grant mechanism is intended to encourage exploratory/developmental research by providing support for the early and conceptual stages of project development (<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/r21.htm"">https://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/r21.htm</a>). It is hoped that this preliminary research will lay the foundation for larger intervention studies that can be funded by other organizations or NIH institutes that support stigma research.</p>    <p><strong>Background/Rationale:</strong></p>    <p>Despite significant advances in biomedical approaches to prevent HIV transmission, acquisition of new infections has not abated, suggesting the need for further research into the possible causes of and new ways to mitigate the spread of the disease (1). While introduction of Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) use for PLWH had significant effects on preventing HIV transmission to seronegative partners, along with other known prevention approaches such as condom use and medical male circumcision, several pockets of new infection have emerged globally (2). Similarly, protocols for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) have been very effective; however, women still bear the burden of increased infection globally, especially adolescent girls, who can potentially continue to transmit HIV to their newborns. These women may not be accessing health care services to obtain information about PMTCT due to stigma associated with their HIV status and/or pregnancy (3, 4). Professional health communities acknowledge that stigma is one of the many reasons for continued transmission of HIV (3, 4), and that stigma creates a barrier to getting tested, treated, and retained in care, especially in LMICs (4).</p>    <p>Stigma is a behavioral manifestation of self or societal disapproval of a condition affecting those that are stigmatized. Stigma affects PLWH overall, including key populations such as sex workers, people who inject drugs, transgender people, prisoners, and men who have sex with men. Adolescents and youth are vulnerable and suffer from public- and/or self- stigma. &nbsp;Early awareness of stigma and its consequences, and exposure to resources that can prevent infection and transmission, may have a large impact during this crucial period, suggesting the importance of further work with this group. Because of their unique psychological and physiological makeup, the ability of adolescents to respond to stigma-related stress have not been well studied. Interventions that increase resiliency and/or provide coping mechanisms may be effective for better health outcomes in all of these groups.</p>    <p>HIV-infected people often also suffer from other infections such as tuberculosis; and other non-communicable diseases such as mental health, metabolic and other neurological disorders, which are themselves subject to stigma. They also suffer stigma due to perceived lifestyle choices. The compounded effect of stigma associated with multiple conditions (layered or intersecting stigma) imposes an extra burden on these people. To develop effective interventions to improve the health outcomes in these groups, it will be important to understand and dissect out the major contributors to stigma and design appropriate interventions.</p>    <p>Another understudied population are exposed but uninfected people, especially children of infected parents and caregivers tending to the sick, who can themselves be targets of stigma that can affect their health in different ways. It is not clear how much of HIV/AIDS stigma related stress in this group of people is the cause of prevention failures and breakdown in care, and what type of interventions may be optimal for providing resilience and motivation to this group of caregivers and family members.</p>    <p>There is a need for better stigma measures that can help assess the efficacy of stigma reduction interventions at different stages of implementation, in different contexts and populations, and at different steps of the HIV/AIDS disease care continuum.&nbsp; &nbsp;This may be particularly necessary in dissecting out the relative contribution of layered or intersecting stigma either due to HIV/AIDS comorbidities and coinfections, or HIV compounded by other factors such as racism, sexism, religious intolerance, and sexual orientation among others.</p>    <p>For the purposes of this FOA:</p>    <ul>    <li>HIV-related health outcomes include any change in the health status of the affected person, group or community that result from an intervention, including but not limited to: employing preventative methods for protection from infection, undergoing HIV testing, adhering to medications, and retention in and maintaining linkage to HIV care. Care seeking behaviors can also be assessed by biological outcomes such as decrease in viral load, among others.</li>    <li>Interventions may employ biomedical, behavioral or structural approaches that are designed to produce a decrease in stigma. Processes that address individual (for example self-stigma), interpersonal, intersectional, or structural (for example cultural norms, institutional practices, and other) stigma for which an intervention can be developed would be considered an appropriate focus for the application.</li>    </ul>    <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>    <p>The objective of this FOA is to lay the groundwork for, or pilot, stigma-reduction interventions to improve HIV health seeking behavior across the HIV care continuum and improve biological and mental outcomes for PLWH or their caregivers.

Clinical genetic testing for selected inherited cancer syndromes has been available since the 1990s. Since then, research and technological advances have identified multiple genes associated with numerous hereditary cancer syndromes. Clinical testing has evolved from a focus on one gene or a limited set of genes to panel tests that cover a wide variety of genes that have reported associations with one or more cancer types. During this time period, insurance coverage for genetic counseling and testing has increased and, for the most part, is based on family history criteria in addition to personal history of cancer. Despite the availability of genetic testing, a substantial number of those at risk are not identified and thus may not benefit from available prevention and early-detection approaches.</p>    <p>The benefits of genetic counseling and testing are that risks of cancer are clarified and appropriate preventive care is provided to high risk individuals. In addition, for those diagnosed with cancer, the results may have implications for treatment. These benefits accrue to both the individual and the individual&rsquo;s family. While optimum approaches based on personal and family history will increase ascertainment, these are selective screening approaches that will identify many, but not all, who carry a mutation. Small family size or incomplete or unknown family history reduces the ability to identify affected families. Tumor-based tests, in addition to identifying cases after the cancer has occurred, are not 100% sensitive and may not be done on all cancer cases. Improved application of family-based testing as well as innovative approaches are needed to increase identification of individuals with an inherited susceptibility to cancer and optimize their follow-up care.</p>    <p>Approaches for case ascertainment of families and affected individuals should have a broad focus on multiple hereditary cancer syndromes. Genes are associated with multiple cancer types, and a cancer type may be associated with multiple genes. For example, hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic alterations is associated with an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers as well as aggressive prostate, pancreatic, and other cancers. Lynch syndrome is associated with an increased risk of colon, endometrial, ovarian, urologic, and other rare cancers. Thus, in practice, multiple syndromes and multiple genes are considered when pursuing testing. Despite the advances in the types and availability of genetic testing, opportunities to counsel and test individuals at high risk of cancer mutations are often missed, especially among low-socioeconomic, minority groups and other underserved populations.</p>    <p>With the widespread availability of multi-gene panel tests, research should address the best methods to identify, counsel and manage individuals for a broad array of cancer family syndromes. Knowledge gaps exist in how to best deliver counseling, testing and follow-up care across diverse populations, for example, those with low income and the uninsured, and across multiple healthcare settings such as rural areas, private or solo practices, community hospitals, and larger healthcare systems. A variety of effective screening modalities tailored to specific populations and healthcare settings are required to maximize case ascertainment, prevent cancer, and improve cancer outcomes among those at high risk of cancer, while minimizing harms. These approaches should be tested to determine best practices tailored to the appropriate population and healthcare setting. Widespread population-based implementation of genetic testing must also address psychological, biobehavioral and ethical questions and concerns such as adequacy of informed consent to address both benefits and harms, communication of risks, outreach to relatives, adequate follow-up care, and potential harms such as discrimination in workplace and life insurance.</p>    <p>To address these challenges and optimize identification and care for individuals with inherited cancer syndromes, innovative approaches are needed across a variety of clinical care settings with outreach to racially/ethnically, socioeconomically, and geographically diverse populations. Although genetic testing for inherited cancer syndromes has been available in the clinical setting for over 20 years, there remain many gaps in our knowledge and the process of care delivery that demand devoting our energies and creativity to benefit the families at risk.

risk perception of pregnancy and familiarity with contraceptive practices to solve HIV prevention uptake and adherence issues. &nbsp;Several MPT candidates have been advanced to clinical testing as &ldquo;first generation&rdquo; MPTs using a drug development strategy focused on adapting the contraceptive drug to an existing anti-HIV microbicide DDS platform. &nbsp;This has resulted in a product pipeline dominated by MPTs consisting of intravaginal rings (IVRs) with the added capacity to deliver Levonorgestrel (LNG). &nbsp;Creation of MPTs with a range of contraceptive choices and anti-HIV drugs that retains the convenience and efficacy of the licensed contraceptive strategy alone will be a critical factor in getting women to substitute their proven contraceptive method for an MPT, since it is unlikely that reduced contraceptive efficacy and/or decreased convenience will entice substitution of an MPT for a more familiar and trusted pregnancy prevention regimen.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives</strong></div>    <p>MPT approaches for development through this FOA MUST be purpose-designed as dual indication co-delivery products for sustained release of all active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) for extended (one month to years) prevention of pregnancy and HIV infection. &nbsp;Products must be the combination of a licensed contraceptive and an antiretroviral (ARV)or non-ARV anti-HIV drug. &nbsp;<em>The proposed MPT must be new and not already in preclinical or clinical development</em>.&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name=""_Hlk486603513""></a>It is expected that products will deliver APIs using delivery methods typically associated with LARCs (implant, injection, transdermal, IUD) and the LARC-like strategies will provide for a minimum of 90 days or 3 menstrual cycles of pregnancy prevention with an antiviral pharmacokinetic (PK) profile (tail) that covers periods of contraceptive non-use, e.g. planned removal for menstrual bleeding or between contraceptive doses.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The following areas of preclinical and behavioral research may be used to achieve the objective of creating the next generation of MPT candidates:</p>    <ul>    <li>Developing new and novel MPT strategies using not only LARC-associated DDS, but also DDS that represent new and novel concepts for delivery of dual indication MPTs.</li>    <li>Understanding the relationship between MPT contraceptive and antiviral efficacy using animal models (simultaneously or in separate harmonized animal model protocols).</li>    <li>Understanding the potential for and identifying/characterizing drug-drug interactions (DDI) that could compromise contraceptive and/or antiviral effectiveness.</li>    <li>Understanding the PK of MPT products by mapping the antiviral and/or contraceptive duration, lag period (time to establish effective concentrations) and tails (time to loss of effective concentrations) during non-use periods such as menstruation or dose renewal.</li>    <li>Understanding the ability of the MPT to deliver antiviral concentrations to both the female reproductive tract (FRT) and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.&nbsp;</li>    <li>Understanding Preferred User Characteristics (PUC), which will govern decisions made by individuals to use the MPT (look and feel), and whether to adopt and maintain use of longer duration MPT strategies. &nbsp;For this FOA, PUCs are defined as the rheological/biophysical properties of the MPT/DDS that invoke user judgments, leading to decisions for first, subsequent use or non-use and/or early termination.</li>    <li>Advancing the MPT in the clinical pipeline by performing studies which position the MPT at the end of five years to either advance to clinical testing, undergo further iterative design or have its development terminated. &nbsp;Regulatory strategies that rely solely on demonstrating MPT contraceptive bioequivalence to the licensed contraceptive alone product are discouraged.</li>    </ul>"11755,Grant,"Enhanced Integrated Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment for Key and Priority Populations; ; ; <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>    <p>Uganda has a total population of 39 million people, of which almost half are aged less than 15 years. There are 1.36 million estimated people living with HIV (PLHIV) with a national prevalence rate of 6.5%. HIV is predominantly heterosexually transmitted across the general population in Uganda, although there is evidence that transmission modes are changing with new infections concentrated in some population sub-groups. With the advent of Test and Start, intensive programmatic investments in targeted testing, differentiated service delivery models (DSDM), and viral load scale-up, it is anticipated that Uganda will achieve a national antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage of 81% by the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, placing the country within reach of achieving the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals by 2020. To efficiently and effectively utilize resources to reach these goals, CDC Uganda targets service delivery to KP/PP with the highest risk of HIV compared to the general population. These subpopulations include female sex workers (FSW) (37% HIV prevalence), fisher-folk (22-29%), long distance truck drivers (25%), uniformed services personnel (18.2%), people who inject drugs (16%), prisoners (15%), and men who have sex with men (MSM) (13.7%). Over the past 2 years, PEPFAR supported initiatives like the Local Capacity Initiative and Advocacy for Better Health have improved the capacity of civil society organizations (CSO) to demand for and create enabling environments for delivery of services to KP. However, Uganda has small scale interventions for KP/PP and the evidence on these service delivery models to scale up is<br />lacking. Sub-populations (FSW and MSM) are often not adequately served in health care settings because of inappropriate delivery models, lack of sensitivity to KP needs, or because of stigma and discriminatory attitudes towards KP.</p>    <p>The goal of this NOFO is to improve the development, implementation, and monitoring of accessible, appropriate, targeted, and evidence informed combination prevention and treatment for KP/PP in Uganda. This should result in an increased use of these services by KP/PP, which will result in these sub-populations attaining the 90-90-90 goals and achieving epidemic control by 2022. The recipient will provide TA to CDC comprehensive regional IPs on improving, monitoring, and evaluating evidence informed combination prevention and treatment interventions for KP/PP, including HIV testing and counseling, prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT), voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), Test and Start, retention in care, and viral load suppression and implementing and evaluating a nationwide training for healthcare workers on gender and sexual identity to reduce the potential for KPs encountering discrimination when seeking care. The recipient will ensure that the community facility strategy is operationalized to support KP/PP service delivery including developing and implementing collaboration standards between IPs, the districts, and the CSOs along with their networks. SI activities, including improving the collection of routine surveillance data and mapping KP/PP hotspots, will support the development and implementation of prevention and treatment activities. The recipient will also support the MOH at national, regional, and district levels to improve surveillance of HIV in KP/PP (including population size estimates and bio-behavioral studies); coordination of KP/PP services; and development of a national plan to serve KP/PP</p>"11766,Grant,"Improved Quality and Sustainability of Medication Assisted Treatment <p><strong>General Information</strong></p>    <p>Document Type: Grants Notice<br />Funding Opportunity Number: CDC-RFA-GH15-159403CONT18<br />Funding Opportunity Title: Improved Quality and Sustainability of Medication Assisted Treatment in Ukraine under the President&rsquo;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)<br />Opportunity Category: Continuation<br />Funding Instrument Type: Cooperative Agreement<br />Category of Funding Activity: Health<br />CFDA Number(s): 93.067 -- Global AIDS<br />Cost Sharing or Matching Requirement: No<br />Version: Synopsis 1<br />Posted Date: Sep 13, 2017<br />Last Updated Date: Sep 13, 2017<br />Original Closing Date for Applications: Nov 14, 2017 <br />Current Closing Date for Applications: Nov 14, 2017 <br />Archive Date: Dec 14, 2017<br /><br /></p>"11781,Grant,"Exploiting Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and/or Host Genomic Information to Understand Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Compartments or Reactivation in Individuals with Substance Use Disorders <p><strong>Background</strong></p>    <p>Both HIV and host genomic information have the potential to help us better understand the molecular mechanisms that establish HIV latency.&nbsp; Upon cellular infection, the approximately 10,000 nucleotide HIV RNA genome is copied into complementary DNA (cDNA) by reverse transcriptase.&nbsp; The other strand of the cDNA is then synthesized and the double-stranded HIV genomic DNA is integrated into the host cell genome where it either remains dormant or is transcribed into new HIV RNA genomes.&nbsp;

Eukaryotic genomes have myriad intrachromosomal and interchromosomal interactions that also contact features such as the nuclear lamina and nuclear bodies.&nbsp; Different types of cells have distinct nuclear structures that could influence the establishment or maintenance of HIV latency.&nbsp;

An H3A ELSI CC is expected to contribute to developing the next generation of ELSI researchers in Africa by providing research opportunities for young scholars, scientists and investigators.</p>    <p>An H3A ELSI CC should also be a resource for the H3Africa Consortium.&nbsp; An H3A ELSI CC should be a knowledge base of multidisciplinary expertise in ethical, legal, and societal issues, and it should be available for consultation, both with individual projects in the H3Africa Consortium and, through the H3Africa Ethics and Regulatory Issues Working Group (http://h3africa.org/consortium/working-groups/24-working-group-external-pages/128-tor-ethics-wg-exp) with the H3Africa Steering Committee.</p>    <p>To ensure that its activities are well organized, integrated and managed, an H3A ELSI CC is expected to include a strong management component to provide the support and organizational structure for all the Center's activities.</p>    <p>The ultimate goal of this FOA is the establishment of one or more sustainable Centers of ELSI scholarship that have sufficient institutional and other research support to maintain the trans-disciplinary Center infrastructure and allow for the continuance of Center activities after the completion of H3Africa funding.</p>    <p>To further clarify the unique nature of an H3Africa ELSI Collaborative Center, the following list of attributes of a Center is provided.</p>    <p>A Center should:</p>    <ul>    <li>conduct research that cannot reasonably be addressed by a standard R01 research grant and that has the potential to lead to significant advances to address a well-defined critical topic area in ELSI research in Africa;</li>    <li>promote intensive and sustainable interactions among investigators from different disciplines, such as the genomic sciences, clinical research, clinical and health policy, ethics, law, the humanities, and other social sciences;</li>    <li>be highly innovative and develop new concepts, methods, analyses, or ways to consider ethical, legal, and social issues that will substantially advance the state of the science in ELSI research on the African continent;</li>    <li>be familiar with H3Africa Consortium activities (see www.h3africa.org for current activities) including ethical, legal, and societal issues that have arisen while conducting genomic research;</li>    <li>be prepared to be a resource for the H3Africa Consortium with regard to addressing ethical, legal, and social issues;</li>    <li>develop and operate with a highly effective management strategy;</li>    <li>develop plans for the timely dissemination of the results of the Center's ongoing activities to key stakeholders (including policy options as appropriate);

Additional objectives of H3Africa.</strong></p>    <p>As noted in the Purpose section, there are several specific objectives that the H3Africa Program is trying to achieve.&nbsp; Successful applicants will become members of the H3Africa Consortium, and will be expected to adhere to these policies, unless adequate justification can be provided.</p>    <p><strong>H3Africa Consortium Participation:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;H3Africa will be organized as a research consortium that brings participants together in a highly collaborative and synergistic effort.&nbsp; The H3Africa Consortium consists of members from the Welcome Trust, the NIH, and all participants of research and infrastructure projects funded through H3Africa.&nbsp; Groups funded under this initiative will be expected to participate in the H3Africa Research Consortium and to collaborate effectively with each other to maximize the chances of overall success of the program. &nbsp;Each funded applicant is expected to participate directly or via proxy in consortium Working Groups that establish rules, guidelines, and resources for the Consortium (a list of H3Africa Working Groups can be found at www.h3africa.org).&nbsp; Each project is expected to comply with applicable consortium policies and procedures (also found at www.h3Africa.org).&nbsp; In addition, the PD/PI(s) will be active members of the H3Africa Steering Committee, which meets regularly by teleconference. The H3Africa Consortium generally holds two meetings per year, usually in Africa.</p>    <p><strong>H3Africa Data Sharing Policies:</strong>&nbsp;H3Africa funds a Bioinformatics Network (http://h3abionet.org /).&nbsp; The research projects and any other H3Africa-funded activity will be required to interact with the H3Africa Bioinformatics Network, and all genetic and genomic data as well as selected associated phenotypes must be submitted to the Network, as well as eventually being submitted to the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA) as outlined in the H3Africa Consortium Data Sharing, Access, and Release Policy (found at http://h3africa.org/consortium/documents).</p>    <p><strong>Community Engagement:</strong>&nbsp;H3Africa recognizes ongoing community engagement and the building of trusting relationships with research participants and the community as an essential feature of ethical biomedical and population based genomics research involving human subjects (www.h3africa.org/consortium/documents).&nbsp; Community engagement can include a variety of activities, such as broad consent for sharing of samples and data, recontact of research participants, return of results to individual participants, or other relevant topics.</p>    <p><strong>Collaborations:</strong>&nbsp; One of the major goals of the H3Africa Initiative is to facilitate opportunities for collaboration between and among investigators within Africa, in order to help build a larger African scientific community, which will in turn lead to more research opportunities and cutting-edge science on the continent.&nbsp; Intra-continental collaborations will also contribute to sustainability of African genomics programs.&nbsp; Each H3Africa ELSI CC is expected to include at least three collaborating projects based in African institutions that will interact to provide the complete capacity needed to carry out the proposed research effort.&nbsp; At least two of the collaborators, in addition to the PD/PI(s) should be based in African institutions outside of the applicant institution.&nbsp; International collaborations within Africa are encouraged, but not required.</p>    <p><strong>Providing the next generation of African researchers with opportunities in genomics:</strong>&nbsp;Establishing the next generation of African researchers to take advantage of genomic approaches to health research is a primary objective of the H3Africa program.&nbsp; H3Africa projects provide a variety of career enhancement opportunities for students, postdoctoral researchers, and young investigators, such as attending seminars and scientific meetings, writing papers, and giving talks.&nbsp; Long-term sustainability and institutional/governmental commitments to research education programs and independent career opportunities are objectives of the H3Africa program.&nbsp;</p>    <p>All applicants are strongly encouraged to contact NIH Staff early in the application process to discuss the alignment of their proposed work with the goals of this FOA, and with the H3Africa Project. Technical Assistance Sessions and teleconferences will be held for potential applicants to this FOA and companion FOAs.&nbsp; NIH staff will be available to answer questions related to this FOA.&nbsp; Location, time, date, and dial in information will be announced in an NIH Guide Notice and will be posted on the H3Africa website:&nbsp; http://www.h3africa.org. During the Information Sessions, NIH staff will present an overview of these FOAs and answer questions from prospective applicants.&nbsp; The Information Sessions are open to all prospective applicants, but participation is not a prerequisite to applying.</p>"11814,Grant,"Morris K. Udall Centers of Excellence for Parkinson's Disease Research <div class=""heading2""><strong>&nbsp;Funding Opportunity Description</strong></div>    <p>Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive movement disorder that affects the lives of at least 500,000 people across the United States, a figure that is expected to increase as our population ages. The average onset of characteristic motor symptoms, which are initially subtle and increasingly impact purposeful movement, occurs in the sixth decade of life; onset at much younger ages is also possible. People with PD also experience significant non-motor symptoms including changes in cognition and mood, sleep disturbances, and autonomic dysfunction. Currently available pharmacological and surgical treatments provide relief from some motor symptoms, but fail to attenuate the ultimate progression of the disease. While significant research advances have been made, including the identification of possible environmental and genetic risk factors, a clear cause and a definitive cure for PD have remained elusive.</p>    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Focus-Research/Focus-Parkinsons-Disease/Udall-Centers"">NINDS Udall Centers of Excellence for Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Research program&nbsp;</a>was established in tandem with the Morris K. Udall Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Research Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-78), legislation to honor the distinguished Representative from Arizona who lived with PD. NINDS Udall Centers have since identified and characterized candidate and disease-associated genes, examined neurobiological and neuropathological mechanisms underlying PD, established improved PD models, developed and tested potential therapeutics, and explored novel avenues of clinical research. In 2017, there are eight Udall Centers across the United States.</p>    <p>The overarching goal of the NINDS Udall Centers of Excellence program is to establish a network of Centers that work collaboratively as well as independently to define the causes of and discover improved treatments for PD. Udall Centers pursue high-impact, synergistic research projects while serving as national leaders in PD research, and local resources for research career enhancement and outreach to the PD patient/advocacy community. Another important goal is to further advance PD research through broad sharing of data and research resources developed through this Centers program. The NINDS Udall Centers program prioritizes innovative and integrative research with significant potential for discovery. Udall Center applications are expected to identify and address an overall research theme that defines a critical challenge in PD research, emphasize novel ideas and approaches, as well as to utilize state-of-the-art technologies and a team-based approach to achieve stated goals. The overall theme of each Center, proposed research projects, and cores will inform the etiology, pathogenesis or treatment of PD; investigations on related synucleinopathies may be included if such studies directly address the identified PD research challenge.</p>    <p>Each applicant team may submit the combination of research projects (basic, translational, clinical) that best address the stated theme. Basic research has served and will continue to serve as the foundation of discovery in the Udall Centers program: applicants are encouraged to include basic research projects, as well as to continue to build upon this vital foundation with studies that translate basic and clinical research observations into improved treatments for PD. Inclusion of a translational research project is optional but encouraged; such projects should provide initial proof-of-concept that a proposed therapeutic agent has sufficient biological activity to warrant further development for the treatment of PD. Clinical research projects include patient-oriented research with a specific focus on understanding disease mechanisms. When formulating their applications, applicants are encouraged to consider the<a href=""https://www.ninds.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2014-PD-Recommendations_0.pdf"">&nbsp;research recommendations</a>&nbsp;resulting from the NINDS conference,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ninds.nih.gov/About-NINDS/Strategic-Plans-Evaluations/Strategic-Plans/Parkinsons-Disease-2014-Advancing-Research"">""Parkinson's Disease 2014: Advancing Research Improving Lives.""</a></p>    <p>The Specialized Center (P50) mechanism supports interdisciplinary, hypothesis-driven research activities.

; ; <div class=""heading3""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p class=""regulartext"">Diabetic foot ulcers are the most common cause of non-traumatic lower leg amputation in the United States.&nbsp; Despite efforts to prevent and treat foot ulcers, each year about 70,000 Americans with diabetes will lose part of their lower extremity because a foot ulcer becomes infected or does not heal.&nbsp; For the 29 million individuals with diabetes in the United States, about 15-25% will have a foot ulcer in their lifetime.&nbsp; Treatment of ulcers adds about $9 to 13 billion to the annual direct medical costs associated with diabetes.&nbsp;</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Risk factors for developing a diabetic foot ulcer include decreased sensation from diabetic neuropathy, reduced blood flow due to vascular damage to large and small vessels, and areas of increased pressure and shear forces from foot deformities.&nbsp; Once an ulcer forms, diabetes impedes the multi-step process of wound healing that comprises hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling and involves a systemic and skin response of cellular and extracellular components.&nbsp; Diabetic wounds often become chronic because they stall in a suboptimal inflammatory phase of healing that is perpetuated by a polymicrobial infection with pathogens that form biofilms.&nbsp; Impaired angiogenesis, stem cell dysfunction and elevated matrix proteases also contribute to poor healing in the diabetic setting.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Despite the importance of this public health problem, the development of effective therapies has been fraught with difficulties with few therapies receiving FDA approval.&nbsp; An obstacle to the development of therapies is the paucity of validated biomarkers to assess healing, infection, and recurrence risk.&nbsp; Another impediment to testing new therapies is the design and implementation of clinical trials in patients with diabetes with complicated wounds and multiple co-morbid conditions.&nbsp; Systematic reviews of clinical studies on the prevention and management of diabetic foot ulcers consistently point to the urgent need for clinical trials with standardized definitions, outcomes, biomarkers, and protocols that will enable a thorough evaluation of treatments and comparison of results across trials.&nbsp; Integral to high quality clinical trials are protocols that are based on compelling research questions; tools that predict healing, monitor response to treatment and measure clinically meaningful outcomes; and clinical sites that can recruit and retain participants and rigorously execute the protocol.&nbsp; The goal of this FOA is to validate biomarkers for diabetic foot ulcers and lay the foundation for a future clinical trial network for testing therapies for diabetic foot ulcers.</p>    <div class=""heading3""><strong>Purpose</strong></div>    <p>The purpose of this FOA is to determine the Clinical Research Units (CRUs) that will initiate the Diabetic Foot Consortium (DFC) for the clinical study of biomarkers. &nbsp;The DFC will consist of the Clinical Research Units (CRUs), a Data Coordinating Center (DCC), the biomarker measurement sites, the NIDDK, and possibly other awardees to future NIDDK efforts on the diabetic foot.</p>    <p>The specific goals of this first funding period of the DFC are:</p>    <ul>    <li>Development of clinical study protocols to validate biomarkers that would fill a critical need for patient care and/or research for diabetic foot ulcers;</li>    <li>Recruitment of participants with a diabetic foot ulcer undergoing standard treatment or with a recent history of a diabetic foot ulcer;</li>    <li>Longitudinal collection of clinical and ulcer data, blood, and ulcer fluid and tissue as part of the protocol;</li>    <li>Measurement of biomarkers on patients and biosamples;

These opportunities are mostly restricted to patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures or implantation for less than 30 days with devices such as ECoG/EEG grids and indwelling penetrating arrays.&nbsp; Among the few stimulating/recording devices that are FDA market-approved for implantation for greater than 30 days are the electrodes for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson and Essential Tremor or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and recent stimulating/recording systems for intractable epilepsy.&nbsp; These inherent challenges associated with research using invasive devices in the human nervous system therefore require a greater degree of planning and interdisciplinary collaboration.&nbsp;</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>FOA Research Objectives</strong></div>    <p>Investigations within the human brain offer revolutionary, but challenging, opportunities for experimental investigation of how the brain senses, thinks, perceives, remembers, plans, registers emotions, activates movements, and makes decisions.&nbsp; Invasive surgical procedures provide the unique ability to record and stimulate neurons within precisely localized brain structures in humans.&nbsp; However, human studies using invasive technology are often constrained by a limited number of patients and resources available to implement complex experimental protocols and are rarely aggregated in a manner that addresses research questions with appropriate statistical power.&nbsp; Therefore, this FOA seeks applications to assemble integrated, multi-disciplinary teams to develop exploratory research efforts to overcome these fundamental barriers.&nbsp; Projects should investigate high-impact questions in human neuroscience and the biological basis of disorders of the human nervous system.&nbsp; Designs should be offered to turn early-stage, range-finding data into mechanistic models and hypotheses, including validation of biological presumptions.&nbsp; Research designs can be offered as pilot projects, exploratory research or activities to establish feasibility, proof-of-principle and early-stage development of technologies or approaches in human neuroscience.&nbsp; Studies that offer planning and development for high temporal resolution of behavioral quantification integrated with invasive recording of brain activity is encouraged, especially those that would transition to utilization in naturalistic environments outside of strict laboratory settings.&nbsp; It is expected that projects funded under this FOA will build teams and data that can later compete for a &ldquo;phase II&rdquo; of continued funding under new or ongoing FOAs of the BRAIN Initiative or other programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name=""_Hlk492472191""></a>An additional goal of this FOA within the NIH BRAIN portfolio is to support human research studies that seek to understand complex human behaviors by precisely measuring and analyzing behavior with high temporal resolution during neural recordings in naturalistic settings.

One criticism of the MDGs, however, is that the gains were largely made by focusing on specific diseases and populations and favoring vertical strategies, done at the expense of comprehensive measures to strengthening health systems and health care delivery. The follow-on call to action to the MDGs, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), shifted the global focus to quality of services, which should translate specific intervention coverage to stronger systems and good health outcomes. One important strategy for improving the quality of service delivery is the support of healthcare workers by ensuring that they are properly mentored to utilize the knowledge, supplies, and equipment that they have, and that they link effectively with communities so that caregivers access services they need. This may be particularly true for families who give birth at home or are not initiating their infants first round of vaccines. Most settings rely on supportive supervision, which is supposed to effectively mentor and build capacity of frontline health workers, improve the quality of services they provide, and positivity impact health outcomes.</p>    <p>However, evidence on the role of supervision has been inconclusive despite the urgent need to capacitate the workforce in low-resource settings. If we are going to continue to make gains on mortality, there is a need to move away from the reliance on traditional check-list based supervision models common in many settings, and explore approaches for sustainable and effectively provide on-the-job training or mentoring of health care workers in a way which results in the delivery of quality health care.

T cell&ndash;based adoptive cell therapy (ACT) includes the use of both tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) extracted from fresh tumor samples and peripheral blood lymphocytes that can be selected and then used either in their natural state or genetically modified.</p>    <p>Cellular product therapies have been used for treating patients with hematologic malignancies after relapse following conventional therapies, but such treatment using T cells in their natural state has seen limited success. On the other hand, recent advances using genetically modified T cells, either through altering the specificity of the T cell receptor (TCR) or through introducing antibody-like recognition via a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to direct the T cell against specific antigens on the malignant cell have shown great promise. Autologous T lymphocytes bearing a CAR directed against the B cell antigen CD19 has shown remarkable efficacy for reducing disease burden for B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Meanwhile, NY-ESO-1-specific T cell receptor (NY-ESO-1 TCR) engineered T cell therapy have also shown promising clinical responses and impressive benefits in patients with multiple myeloma. In contrast, genetically-directed cell therapies for solid tumors has had limited success and faces unique challenges because of inherent heterogeneity, limited accessibility and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Recently, TIL therapy has seen remarkable successes for some patients with advanced cancer, particularly metastatic melanoma. Despite current successes, cellular immunotherapy clinical trials are only in the beginning of exploring the potential of ACT, and CAR-redirected T cells in particular, for treating cancer patients.</p>    <p>Success of clinical trials in cellular therapies is tempered by challenging, often life-threatening unique toxicities. An infrastructure to collect and analyze outcomes data across multiple cell therapies, both short and long-term, from multiple academic centers, regardless of their treatment institution or source of cells, has the potential to facilitate research, development, and implementation of these therapies. In fact, although short-term data from current trials are now collected, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has indicated requirements for following recipients of genetically modified cells for at least 15 years, to better understand the late effects of these therapies. Although pharmaceutical companies are undertaking pivotal clinical trials in this area, and obtaining rights to manufacture and commercialize cellular products for their trials, there is little incentive for companies to provide a national, centralized database resource to accomplish this mandate. Finally, a resource to aid investigators in the use of this data for observational research studies in cellular therapies, is also an important unmet need.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Goals and Requirements of this FOA</strong></div>    <p><strong>Overall Goals for the Cellular Immunotherapy Data Resource (CIDR):</strong></p>    <p>Responsive applications must ensure that the CIDR provides the academic community, as well as relevant pharmaceutical partners, with an infrastructure for collection of high quality data, including demographics, primary tumor characteristics, course of cancer treatment, cellular product manufacturing details, adverse events and outcomes, from patients undergoing cellular therapies for treatment of malignancies in either clinical trials (NCI-sponsored, investigator-initiated, or pharmaceutical company-sponsored) or with an FDA-approved agent and indication, using either autologous T or natural killer (NK) cells, cellular vaccines, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) or genetically modified T cells (CARs).</p>    <p><strong>Organization of the Cellular Immunotherapy Data Resource:</strong></p>    <p>The CIDR<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is expected to focus on providing an infrastructure for data collection and data verification management from cellular therapies across the multiple sources as well as facilitating retrospective observational research studies using CIDR data.</p>    <p>This data resource must ensure/provide all of the following capabilities and functions (but additional relevant aspects should also be considered):</p>    <ul>    <li>The electronic process for data collection including the data forms for each of the various steps in a cell therapy procedure, e.g. pre-cellular therapy form, cell infusion form, and post-cellular therapy form, for capturing cell product characteristics, indications for use, clinical status, concomitant therapies, route and schedule of administration, infusion reactions, adverse events, key safety, and efficacy endpoints at key dates;</li>    <li>Mechanism for payment to centers for forms submission;</li>    <li>Data quality control procedures, via data validation and data auditing;</li>    <li>Strategies to collect long-term data (over the 15-year period mandated by the FDA) from patients on genetically modified cellular therapies;</li>    <li>Mechanisms for aggregation and integration, for management of data from various sources, such as patient clinical baseline and outcomes data from either academic centers or pharmaceutical companies, for purposes of data sharing;</li>    <li>Work closely with NCI staff to establish common data elements, data standards, metadata requirements, controlled vocabularies, and quality control metrics for all CIDR data to ensure that the data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) to ensure the data and results are maximally useful to the public;</li>    <li>Integration of data elements construct into a variety of external data systems, including development of an Application Programming Interface (API) to facilitate interactions with other Cancer Moonshot data coordinating centers and components of the Cancer Data Ecosystem;</li>    <li>Handling proprietary or patented information, blinded data from clinical trials, timelines for release of data for sharing with the scientific community, etc.;</li>    <li>A web page for access to investigators for data submission forms and other CIDR information;</li>    <li>A Scientific Working Committee and the procedures for the review, prioritization and implementation of the proposed observational studies requesting use of resource data;

The country is on its way to controlling the<br />HIV/AIDS epidemic and accomplishing UNAIDS&rsquo;s 90-90-90 target. Rwanda&rsquo;s HIV program<br />success can be attributed to significant health system investments in human resources with<br />PEPFAR support. PEPFAR support to HRH has been fundamental to building systems in order<br />to ensure quality of HIV service delivery. Support has included innovative initiatives to increase<br />health workforce production, retention, and productivity; compensation packages in the form of<br />salaries and stipends; continuous professional development and other training opportunities to<br />maintain HIV treatment and care at facility and community settings.

The project will address the following objectives:<br /> Describe PEPFAR investments in HRH in Rwanda from 2009 to present, including preservice<br />and in-service training, salary support, and other related investments.<br /> Describe the cost, geographic and site distribution, utilization, and workload of<br />PEPFAR-funded and other HRH in Rwanda in the areas of HIV clinical services,<br />laboratory, prevention, strategic information, and health systems strengthening, in<br />relation to programmatic priorities, outputs and outcomes of HIV prevention, care, and<br />treatment programs from 2009 to present.<br />3 of 57<br /> Examine the potential impact on HRH and PEPFAR program outcomes as a result of the<br />decline in PEPFAR funding from 2009 to present.<br /> Examine the outcomes of Rwanda&rsquo;s new differentiated models of HIV service delivery<br />on (the need, cost, distribution, utilization, and workload of) HRH.<br /> Evaluate patient or population level national HIV program outcomes.<br /> Evaluate cost, cost-effectiveness and/or cost-benefit of the differentiated service delivery<br />model (DSDM).<br />The outcome of this evaluation is to increase knowledge of the impact PEPFAR funding for<br />HRH has had on Rwanda&rsquo;s HIV/AIDS program and to increase knowledge about how PEPFAR<br />Rwanda&rsquo;s HRH strategy has impacted HIV services delivery, particularly regarding decreasing<br />HIV incidence, increasing access and coverage for HIV services, and maintaining quality of<br />HIV service provision. This includes support to increase HRH supply and production, HRH<br />performance to maintain quality care in facilities and communities, and HRH capacity to<br />improve HIV program implementation. This is of particular importance for scale-up and<br />strengthening in other PEPFAR priority countries.<br />The evaluation should use a participatory approach which seeks the views and assessments of<br />all stakeholders involved. Evaluations are important for establishing and strengthening<br />innovative, emerging, and best practices in HIV/AIDS and TB programs. Findings provided by<br />evaluation activities will help establish the metrics and benchmarks for defining and measuring<br />success.

The symptom burden experienced by people with cancer is considerable. Cancer and its treatments produce deleterious symptoms that can persist long after treatment is completed and disease is eradicated. Across disease stages and phases of care, approximately 33% of cancer patients report three or more co-occurring symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue) that they rate moderate to severe. Poorly controlled symptoms negatively affect health-related quality of life and functional status, and can lead to costly visits to emergency departments, often resulting in hospitalization. Adverse symptoms can lead to delays, in or discontinuation of, cancer treatment. Such disruptions may decrease treatment effectiveness and increase risk for recurrence and death. Adherence problems due to poor symptom control are especially salient among minority and medically underserved cancer patients. Finally, negative effects of treatment have been found to increase the likelihood that patients will not return to work, even if they are disease-free, and impair the ability to work among those who do return.</p>    <p><em>Patient-reported outcomes (PROs).</em>&nbsp;The importance of directly capturing the perspective of patients on their own health status and recognition that patients are an essential source of information about their symptom experience and its impact on their functioning have become a major focus of research. To better assess and manage cancer patient symptoms, there has been growing interest in the use of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to enable standardized symptom assessment. PROs have been shown to be valid and reliable tools for assessing symptoms and are being used increasingly as outcomes in clinical trials. Given this increased uptake in clinical research settings, their use in applied clinical settings has become easier and more appealing. Research demonstrates that oncology care providers consider PRO data to be clinically useful and that collection of PROs as part of clinical care is generally feasible and acceptable to patients. To support their collection, electronic systems have been developed and are in use at several major cancer centers for patient self-reporting of symptoms using established PRO assessment tools. Advantages of electronic systems over paper-and-pencil approaches include the ease of administration and scoring, reduced patient burden (e.g., via computer adaptive testing), and the capability of integrating findings into electronic health record (EHR) systems and existing workflows. However, many of the systems for symptom data capture are idiosyncratic, rarely interoperable, and generally do not provide evidence-based symptom management recommendations in response to symptom reports. Thus, there is a substantial need for systematic, uniform data capture and presentation across clinical settings. In addition, research is needed on the best approaches to streamline PRO data collection and use these data to aid in doctor-patient communication, decision-making, and care-coordination across practice settings (e.g., between primary and specialty care practices and among specialty care practices).</p>    <p><em>Clinical use of PROs</em>. Going beyond feasibility and acceptability, results of controlled studies demonstrate the benefits of collection of PRO data and their delivery to cancer care providers. Clinical use of PROs has been shown repeatedly to improve patient-physician communication about symptoms and individual studies have demonstrated improved symptom control, increased use of supportive care measures, and greater patient satisfaction. The cumulative evidence suggests that effects are likely to be enhanced if clinicians and patients are provided with clear guidance on how to respond to symptom reports. Accordingly, there is an emerging consensus that development and adoption of integrated symptom monitoring and management systems represent the most effective way to use PROs to improve symptom control.</p>    <div class=""heading4"">Research Objectives and Main Requirements</div>    <p><strong>Overview</strong>. The focus of the Research Consortium supported by this FOA is to use implementation science approaches to accelerate adoption of integrated systems that collect patient-reported symptom data and use these data to trigger a clinical response consistent with evidence-based guidelines. Implementation science approaches to be proposed for this FOA must be systematically planned with a goal to accomplish sustaining changes in clinical practice<em>.</em></p>    <p><strong>Goals and Expected Role of Research Centers.</strong>&nbsp;Each Research Center is expected to deploy an integrated symptom monitoring and management system in a group of clinical practices and to test that system using a randomized design. This approach is expected to yield a rigorous evaluation of the extent to which elements of the system are adopted and the impact of the system on patient outcomes, cancer treatment delivery, and healthcare utilization.</p>    <p>The proposed Research Centers should be capable of (and plan for) accomplishing the following goals during the project period:</p>    <ul>    <li>Yield optimal models for implementing integrated systems into routine clinical practice;</li>    <li>Verify whether adoption of integrated systems to be assessed can reduce the harmful effects of poorly controlled symptoms; and</li>    <li>Create the foundation for effective, scalable and sustainable symptom management approaches in routine cancer care.</li>    </ul>    <p><strong>General Requirements on Study Design</strong></p>    <p>The proposed studies must use a pragmatic, randomized design that:</p>    <ul>    <li>Provides an integrated symptom monitoring and management system to a group of clinical practices based on implementation science principles;</li>    <li>Measures the extent of adoption and identifies processes that contribute to success in adopting the system; and</li>    <li>Determines the impact of the integrated system on patient outcomes (e.g., symptom reports, functional status), cancer treatment delivery (e.g., adherence to prescribed medications), and healthcare utilization (e.g., emergency room visits).</li>    </ul>    <p><strong>Required Research Center Characteristics</strong></p>    <p>The proposed Research Center must adopt all the required characteristics listed below.</p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent""><strong><em>Integrated cancer symptom monitoring and management system.&nbsp;</em></strong>The integrated system must include regular assessment of cancer patient symptoms in a set of clinical practices. Symptom assessment must include pain or fatigue, along with other symptoms that are relevant for the patient population selected (e.g., by cancer type and stage of disease). Management strategies must be based on current clinical guidelines for symptom management. The system must provide point of care clinical decision support and care-coordination based on the presence and severity of symptoms. Deployment of the integrated system must be based on implementation science principles that take into account patient, provider, and practice characteristics and beliefs, knowledge, and abilities regarding proposed changes in clinical practice.</p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent""><strong><em>Patient Populations and Healthcare Delivery Practices</em></strong></p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent"">Patients in the clinical practices should vary by type of cancer and may vary by age group (e.g., they may include pediatric or older adult patients). Each integrated symptom management system must collect information (at the practice level) from patients representing at least two out of three phases of the cancer treatment continuum:</p>    <p class=""IndentListParagraph"">(1) Treatment with curative intent (i.e., as patients receive surgery, standard- or high-dose chemotherapy, biological therapy, and/or radiotherapy with curative intent);</p>    <p class=""IndentListParagraph"">(2) Treatment with non-curative/palliative intent (e.g., for patients with advanced or metastatic disease who receive chemotherapy, biological therapy, and/or radiotherapy to control or slow advance of their disease); and</p>    <p class=""IndentListParagraph"">(3) Cancer survivorship (i.e., patients who have completed active cancer treatment with curative intent, including those who may be receiving maintenance or prophylactic cancer treatment).</p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent""><strong><em>Clinical Informatics and Information Technology Approaches.&nbsp;</em></strong>Symptoms must be collected via electronic data capture, integrated into electronic health record (EHR) systems, and extracted from EHRs. One, uniform electronic platform must be used for all clinical practices in the Research Center. It is expected that the electronic platform will possess functionality for collecting PROs and providing scored information to clinicians. Data must be collected in formats that allow for sharing across funded Research Centers. The electronic platform must be fully operational (e.g., already embedded within the EHR, or able to seamlessly interface with the EHR such as with online tools, apps, or software with application programming interface capabilities). Awardees may use the early stages of the project for final refinement of the platform at the clinical practice sites as well as for refinement of the process of delivering scored information to patients and clinicians.</p>    <p><strong>Research Center Organization</strong></p>    <p>Each Research Center will be composed of the following functional and structural units:</p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent""><strong><em>Administrative Unit</em></strong></p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent"">This Core will be responsible for the day-to-day management and administrative coordination of all Research Center activities, and should provide infrastructure that will allow the Research Center leadership to oversee all aspects of symptom management, system implementation and data collection across clinic practices. Because complex, multilevel data will be collected and acted upon from multiple clinical practices for analysis and evaluation, close coordination and efficient lines of communication are needed between this core and the practices.</p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent""><strong><em>Research Design and Implementation Unit</em></strong></p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent"">This Unit will be responsible for deploying the integrated symptom monitoring and management system using implementation science principles and current cancer clinical practice guidelines. It will be responsible for the design and conduct of the randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness of the integrated system and its scalability and sustainability.

It will be responsible for the collection and management of multilevel patient and healthcare data as well as process-level data to evaluate the implementation of the integrated system. This unit will work with the Coordinating Center (U24) to ensure uniform, interoperable data collection and sharing with the other funded Research Centers. Where there is overlap on PROs or other outcomes assessed, common data elements will be used.

Accordingly, there is an emerging consensus that development and adoption of integrated symptom assessment and management systems represent the most effective way to use PROs to improve symptom control.</p>    <div class=""heading4"">Research Objectives and Main Requirements</div>    <p><strong>Overview</strong>. The focus of the Research Consortium supported by this FOA is to use implementation science approaches to accelerate adoption of integrated systems that collect patient-reported symptom data and use these data to trigger a clinical response consistent with evidence-based guidelines. Implementation science approaches to be proposed for this FOA must be systematically planned with a goal to accomplish sustaining changes in clinical practice<em>.&nbsp;</em>This FOA will fund one Coordinating Center to coordinate and support the efforts of the Research Centers funded under a parallel announcement. Because complex, multilevel data will be collected and acted upon from multiple clinical practices for analysis and evaluation, close coordination and efficient lines of communication are needed between the Coordinating Center and the Research Centers. Coordinating Center applicants must familiarize themselves with the UM1 FOA and all the detailed requirements for UM1 studies.</p>    <p><strong>The Main Responsibilities of the Coordinating Center</strong></p>    <p>The Coordinating Center is expected to be responsible for the following activities:</p>    <p>1.

The overall goal of each HTA Research Center is the construction of at least one, and up to three, pilot-scale human tumor atlases describing one of three important transitions in tumorigenesis: the transition from locally invasive to metastatic cancer; the dynamics of patient response to therapy; or the development of resistance to therapy. For the purposes of this FOA, a comprehensive human tumor atlas is defined as the multidimensional molecular, cellular, and morphological mapping of human cancers, complemented with critical spatial information (at the molecular, cellular, and/or tissue level) that facilitate visualization of the structure, composition, and multiscale interactions within the tumor ecosystem.</p>    <p>HTA Research Centers will be part of the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), which will also include PreCancer Atlas (PCA) Research Centers (solicited under&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ca-17-035.html"">RFA-CA-17-035</a>), a HTAN Data Coordinating Center (HTAN-DCC, solicited under&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ca-17-036.html"">RFA-CA-17-036</a>) and an HTAN Tissue Coordinating Center (anticipated to be solicited in Fiscal Year 2019).</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p>NCI convened the Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) in 2016 to provide recommendations for achieving the Cancer Moonshot's ambitious goal of making a decade's worth of progress in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in just 5 years, now called the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative"">Beau Biden Cancer MoonshotSM&nbsp;Initiative</a>. The BRP was charged with assessing the state of the science in specific areas and identifying major research opportunities that could uniquely benefit from the support of the Cancer Moonshot and could lead to significant advances in our understanding of cancer and in how to intervene in its initiation and progression. The recommendations focused on areas in which a coordinated effort could profoundly accelerate the pace of progress in the fight against cancer and were not intended to replace existing cancer programs, initiatives, and policies already underway.

While the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative/blue-ribbon-panel/blue-ribbon-panel-report-2016.pdf"">BRP final report</a>&nbsp;includes a specific recommendation for the&nbsp;<em>Generation of Human Tumor Atlases</em>&nbsp;to facilitate our understanding of important transitions during the course of tumorigenesis and to inform clinical decision-making and treatment options for patients, this FOA establishes a detailed framework for the accomplishment of the BRP goals.</p>    <p>A major hindrance to prevention, early detection, and treatment of cancer is the lack of comprehensive knowledge of the molecular, cellular, and tissue alterations that drive tumor development and progression from its earliest stages. It is now well appreciated that the tumor ecosystem, which is defined by a full suite of cell types including tumor cells, tumor-associated immune, stroma, and vascular cells, and the accompanying patient normal and stem cell populations, evolves during tumor development and treatment. Interactions between evolving cellular and non-cellular components within the tumor ecosystem can facilitate a variety of tumor behaviors including unchecked tumor growth due to positive feedback loops mediated by tumor and stromal cell-associated secreted factors, tumor cell invasion mediated by biophysical cues arising from dysregulated extracellular matrix architectures, or positive patient outcomes, such as tumor resolution via an activated immune system. Mechanistic studies involving isolated cell populations or non-human model systems provide significant insights into the molecular underpinnings of these tumor phenotypes and have led to development of effective therapies in some contexts. However, precision medicine strategies have proven ineffective in many cancer patients due in part to an incomplete understanding of how interactions within the tumor ecosystem promote or suppress tumorigenesis.</p>    <p>Emerging single-cell and&nbsp;<em>in situ</em>&nbsp;technologies are now facilitating the multi-omic characterization of all major cell types (normal, pre-malignant, malignant, stromal, vascular, and immune) and their interactions at sites of tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis. Integration of these data with non-invasive measurements from liquid biopsy techniques and/or a variety of imaging modalities, such as multimodal molecular imaging or high-resolution optical imaging, could result in a multiparameter, multidimensional view of the evolving tumor ecosystem during cancer progression. Recognizing that a concerted, multidisciplinary effort to map human tumors could significantly accelerate scientific discovery and inform clinical decision-making, the Cancer Moonshot BRP recommended construction of dynamic tumor atlases that utilize new and existing data sets to comprehensively characterize the components and interactions within the three-dimensional tumor ecosystem over time. Ultimately, a complete set of human tumor atlases will represent the multidimensional molecular, cellular, and morphological mapping of the structure, composition and interactions within human cancers including dynamic changes that occur during key transitions in cancer, such as the progression of pre-malignant lesions toward malignancy, the initiation of invasive, metastatic disease, and the development of resistance to therapy.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives and Main Requirements</strong></div>    <p class=""regulartext""><strong>Goal of the Human Tumor Atlas Network:</strong></p>    <p><a name=""_Hlk493702313""></a>The NCI intends to support HTA and PCA Research Centers that will function as part of the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN). The HTAN effort builds upon and extends the efforts of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) which provided genomic and transcriptomic characterization of many tumor types, resulting in an important resource for the scientific and clinical communities while promoting advances in associated technologies and bioinformatic approaches. The HTAN will focus on longitudinal studies of pre-cancer, metastasis, and drug resistance with an emphasis on collecting comprehensive clinical data over time. Furthermore, the tumor atlases generated by the HTAN will facilitate understanding of interactions within multidimensional architecture of the tumor microenvironment, including the role of the immune system, normal cells, and non-cellular components. HTAN will build upon the lessons learned from TCGA, address its limitations, and use evolving state-of-the-art information technology and other emerging technologies to achieve its goal.</p>    <p>The goal of the HTAN is the construction of human tumor atlases that describe the multidimensional cellular, morphological and molecular mapping of human cancers over time for informing future cancer research and, ultimately, clinical decision-making.

This funding announcement is a reissue of&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-AI-12-038.html"">RFA-AI-12-038</a>&nbsp;and expands areas of investigation to include immune mechanisms involved in oral, dental and craniofacial health during aging. Innovative approaches using human samples and samples from relevant animal models are strongly encouraged to gain insight into the function of the immune system in elderly subjects. The ultimate goal of this program is to expand current knowledge and insight of aging-related immune function that may be used to improve immune status and reduce morbidity and mortality in the elderly.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p>The number of persons over 60 years of age has increased substantially in recent years worldwide and is projected to grow to 1.4 billion by 2030, according to the United Nations. Older individuals exhibit an increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, with increased respiratory and/or cardiovascular complications and prolonged hospitalization.&nbsp; Lower respiratory tract infections are the most common cause of infectious disease hospitalizations in older adults and the 6th leading cause of death in the United States, with 90% of the deaths occurring in individuals who are over 65 years old. Complications such as bacterial superinfection and meningitis can result from a primary viral infection, resulting in increased hospitalizations and mortality with age.&nbsp; Although vaccination plays an important role in reducing the burden of infectious disease, the efficacy is variable and reduced in the elderly, likely due to declining immune function.&nbsp; Moreover, aging is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation that is thought to contribute to age-related chronic diseases such as metabolic syndrome, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, and atherosclerosis. Little is known about how molecular variations in immune responses related to recognition and interaction with microbes increase the risk of inflammatory diseases in the aged population.&nbsp; Mechanisms connecting chronic inflammation with chronic diseases also remain unclear.&nbsp; A better understanding of the mechanisms of the aging immune response and chronic inflammatory conditions that accompany aging are required.</p>    <p>Profound changes in the human immune system occur during aging and have been implicated in weakened immune responses in the elderly.&nbsp; Such changes include altered Toll-like Receptor signaling, accumulation of terminally differentiated T cells and oligoclonal expansion of the memory T cell pool, as well as an overall decline in circulating B cells and impaired B cell functions.&nbsp; Changes are also observed in aged hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), and include reduced repopulation capability, homing, and self-renewal, and a skewed differentiation toward the myeloid lineage. Mechanisms governing age-induced thymic atrophy have been difficult to resolve because of the challenges involved in isolating stromal cells, the primary targets of atrophy. Na&iuml;ve T cells may persist in human lymphoid tissues despite thymic atrophy, but their potential role in immune responses throughout aging is not well-understood.&nbsp; In recent years, a variety of technological approaches have been developed and used to better understand the human immune response to infections or vaccines.&nbsp; Examples include technologies such as gene expression profiling, nucleic acid sequencing, protein microarrays, metabolomics, antibody and T cell receptor profiling, multiparameter flow cytometry, and mass cytometry. Given the scarcity of blood and/or tissue samples available from the elderly, utilizing a combination of approaches could facilitate the assessment and evaluation of multiple cell functions from limited human samples.&nbsp; Understanding the biological basis of immune changes upon aging and elucidating mechanisms by which these changes influence vaccine responses or susceptibility to infection would be important for improving responses in the elderly.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Changes occur in the immune system in the oral cavity with aging, and in many ways, reflect changes that occur throughout the body with increasing age. Oral and dental diseases are among the most common chronic disorders affecting humans. For example, periodontal disease is prevalent among older adults, afflicting about 70% of adults 65 years and older. With aging, the oral mucosa demonstrates a loss of tissue integrity, the mucosa becomes less resilient, accompanied by a reduction in the microvasculature, leading to impaired wound healing. Reports have also identified changes in the composition of saliva as a person ages, and anatomical changes occur in the major and minor salivary glands. The majority of older adults on multiple medications suffer from adverse effects such as dry mouth that are rarely considered.&nbsp; Frailty also influences the pathogenesis of oral diseases, probably through biological and environmental pathways that are linked to the common burden of inflammation. Studies suggest that impaired expression and function of TLRs, cytokine and chemokine production, neutrophils, and monocytes/macrophages are associated with aging and periodontitis. T cells have been reported to contribute to inflammation and mucosal lesion formation, however, a clear understanding of the mechanisms by which T cell subsets and innate immune cells contribute to oral pathology and oral health during aging remain to be determined.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives and Scope</strong></div>    <p>This initiative seeks projects that are focused on understanding the age-related changes that occur in immune function and influence responses to pathogens and vaccines, as well as projects focused on the effects of age-related changes in immune cell function/composition on oral and craniofacial health.&nbsp; The goal of this FOA is to accelerate research to better understand the impact of aging on the immune system in order to improve immune responses to infections and vaccines for the elderly. Infectious diseases selected for proposed studies should be appropriately justified in the context of an older adult population. As many of the changes evident in the elderly may begin at younger ages (50-60 years or younger), comparisons between this age group and older individuals, or projects studying immune changes emerging at this age group are also of interest.&nbsp; Additionally, this initiative seeks to expand research addressing basic immune mechanisms associated with oral, dental, and craniofacial health and pathologies in the elderly.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Human studies are a required element of each application.&nbsp; Appropriately aged animal models, including humanized mice, may be included to extend upon human studies and/or dissect mechanisms using approaches that may not be feasible in humans. This FOA will support clinical trials where the primary objective is to obtain human samples for mechanistic studies of immune function.&nbsp; Such mechanistic trials include: recruitment of individuals to administer licensed vaccines for their intended use or off-label in terms of timing, cohorts, etc.; administration of investigational vaccines or adjuvants; and/or pathogen exposure/challenge studies.&nbsp; Study samples also may be included from independently funded clinical trials or those obtained from repositories such as the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (<a href=""https://www.blsa.nih.gov/"">BLSA</a>).&nbsp; Interested applicants are expected to establish collaborations with investigators responsible for these repositories prior to submitting an application to this FOA.</p>    <p>Applicants proposing to use aged rodents may be able to obtain them from the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dab/aged-rodent-colonies-handbook/eligibility-criteria-use-nia-aged-rodent-colonies"">National Institute of Aging</a>&nbsp;(<a href=""https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dab/aged-rodent-colonies-handbook/eligibility-criteria-use-nia-aged-rodent-colonies"">https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dab/aged-rodent-colonies-handbook/eligibility-criteria-use-nia-aged-rodent-colonies</a>) or from the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.jax.org/jax-mice-and-services/find-and-order-jax-mice/most-popular-jax-mice-strains/aged-b6"">Jackson Laboratories</a>.

Over the past decade, there has been a major expansion in the scope of approaches, technologies and expertise required to effectively address any research question. A typical research activity includes molecular, genomic, phenotypic, and functional characterizations, each of which entails sophisticated technologies and understanding (e.g., deep sequencing, bioinformatics, imaging, flow cytometry, animal modeling, etc.). Accompanying the increases in the number of required approaches is the growing need for exceptional scientists with extensive research experience in each of those areas who provide continuity, stability and detailed scientific knowledge beyond that of a technician or a trainee. There is already a clustering of individual small research groups around central cores that specialize in different expertise (e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR], mass spectrometry [MS], sequencing, fluorescence-activated cell sorting [FACS], biochemistry, animal models, etc.), such that many experiments are performed, at least in part, through such cores. In addition, with the generation of large datasets (""big data"") that are publicly available, there is a growing need for IT experts within many research programs or departments that previously did not rely on these skill sets. Data scientists (e.g., informaticians, statisticians, epidemiologists, behavioral scientists, and population scientists) are found primarily in computational biology groups or in data-rich big science groups. The need for such individuals is rapidly expanding to many other types of research groups.</p>    <p>There has been a continuing shift in the way research is organized, with increased reliance on a cadre of Research Specialists in laboratories, cores, and other scientific support facilities. Extramural institutions have begun to address the need for such scientists by providing staff support for cores that serve multiple research programs. Moreover, individual research programs have created Research Specialist positions using their grant support. However, neither of these positions currently provides the individual with either the recognition or independent funding mechanism that will attract and maintain the best scientists.

The phenotype of HIV-induced CNS dysfunction has evolved over the past two decades with mild to moderate forms of disease affecting a significant portion of virally suppressed individuals. The pathognomonic HIV- induced CNS pathology is rarely seen in autopsies of ART suppressed individuals exhibiting mild to moderate forms of cognitive dysfunction. Concurrently over the past decade, the fields of connect-omics and neuronal circuitry have significantly expanded leading to a better understanding of the relationship between function and anatomical connectivity.</p>    <p>To better understand the neuro-pathogenesis and the etiology of clinical outcomes observed in people living with HIV on modern ART regimens, studies examining neuronal networks, neural receptors, neuroimaging paradigms and pathways that could potentially take advantage of the recent discoveries in the fields of connect-omics and neuronal circuitry are needed. Such efforts also have the potential to provide a framework to develop quantitative bio-medical diagnostic tools that reflect the true nature and extent of neurocognitive impairment, thereby diminishing the reliance on complicated subjective neuropsychiatric batteries.

The Stop TB Partnership (&ldquo;STBP&rdquo;), under the direction of the Executive Director is leading the way to a world without tuberculosis (TB), a disease that is curable but still kills three people every minute. Founded in 2001, the Partnership&rsquo;s mission is to serve every person who is vulnerable to TB and ensure that high-quality treatment is available to all who need it.</p>    <p>As a key initiative of the Stop TB Partnership, the goal of the Global Drug Facility (GDF) is to facilitate worldwide, equitable access to TB medicines and diagnostics across both public and private sectors. This goal is achieved through management and coordination of market activities for the full portfolio of TB medicines and diagnostics, strategic procurement and innovative logistics solutions, technical assistance and capacity building for TB programmes in better pharmaceutical management practices, and accelerated uptake of new TB medicines, regimens, and diagnostics.</p>    <p>GDF, through this Call for Proposal (CFP), invites proposals from qualified organizations interested in receiving grant support to develop and implement a plan that will catalyse the use of paediatric formulations of second-line drugs to treat drug-resistant TB.</p>    <p>It is estimated that more than 30,000 children develop active multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) each year. However, globally, just over 1,000 children have ever been documented to have received MDRTB treatment. There is a vast gap between the estimated need and the actual number of children diagnosed and initiated on treatment. And, until recently, the only available products to treat children were the adult formulations of second-line drugs. These formulations present many obstacles to appropriate treatment for children, including: 1) inability to administer the correct dose as the adult tablets are usually not scored, nor are they intended to be crushed and mixed, 2) they are challenging for parents and caregivers to prepare and administer, and 3) they are difficult for children to take (e.g., unpalatable). However, there has been a recent focus on improving the sensitivity of TB diagnostics, particularly using new specimen types that are easier to get from children compared to a sputum sample. There has also been a renewed focus on household contact tracing to identify people exposed to MDR-TB. It is likely, as these two approaches expand, more children with MDR-TB who need treatment will be identified. In anticipation of this, paediatric formulations of a number of second-line medicines have been developed, meaning children may be able to receive proper treatment for the first time ever. While the advances in diagnostic sensitivity and household contact tracing are forthcoming, the number of children currently being diagnosed and treated remains low. In the immediate term, the low demand risks that the formulations will not be used in practice. Longer term, this may present barriers to broader use and new product development.</p>    <p>The objective of this CFP is to identify an organization with a proven track record working in paediatric TB particularly MDR-TB, which can identify and coordinate early adopter programmes to catalyse the use of these new formulations, particularly from a procurement and supply chain management perspective</p>"12222,Grant,"Collaboration with Academia to Strengthen Public Health Workforce Capacity  <p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>    <p>Part A supports Healthy People objectives related to immunization and infectious diseases, funding will assess need, development, implement, promote, revise, maintain and evaluate immunization education materials and resources for health professionals providing immunization services, specifically physicians, nurses, medical assistants and other allied health professionals.</p>    <p>The goal of the partnership is to build capacity of health care professionals by creating credible immunization training and education resources based on recommendations by experts in immunization and training education resources to be able to efficiently and effectively handle, store and administer vaccines while addressing patient concerns</p>"12239,Grant,"Elucidating Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and HIV-treatment Associated Metabolic/Endocrine Dysfunction     <p><a name=""_Toc258873267""></a><strong>Purpose</strong></p>    <p>Metabolic and endocrine perturbations including insulin resistance, diabetes, and dyslipidemia have been of significant concern in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals before and after the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and prior studies have shown that HIV-infected individuals may be at risk of accelerated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Moreover, while HIV infection and first-generation ART therapies have been associated with adipose tissue/lipodystrophic changes and disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism, more recent data suggest that immune activation and inflammation from chronic HIV infection may also play an important role in HIV-associated metabolic/endocrine dysfunction. Given the recent advances in ART, an increasing number of HIV-infected individuals are virologically controlled and living longer; as such, the trajectory of HIV-associated morbidity has shifted from one of primarily acute opportunistic infections and immune dysfunction to one including chronic metabolic and/or endocrine complications. Furthermore, as the long-term survival of HIV-infected patients improves in the absence of a definitive cure, the duration of ART use in HIV-infected patients will continue to lengthen and other therapies associated with conditions that commonly occur with aging will also affect their well-being. The adoption of chronic pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention with ART in at-risk individuals may also put those individuals at increased risk for ART-associated metabolic perturbations.</p>    <p>Although the etiology of metabolic/endocrine complications in HIV-infected individuals despite viremic control is poorly understood, it is most likely related to the interplay of host, viral, and ART factors and the complex interactions among the long-term consequences of infection and HIV itself, chronic ART, and the underlying inflammatory process. Previous classes of ART, such as protease inhibitors and reverse transcriptase inhibitors, have been implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, altered adipogenesis and differentiation, and impaired glucose and lipid homeostasis. But, advances in drug development have introduced newer ART agents with strategies to target novel mechanisms of action (including HIV entry and integrase inhibitors), minimize metabolic perturbations, and improve patient adherence with multi-class combinations. These combinations in turn trigger not well understood processes that may have a negative impact in numerous metabolic pathways. Pending a cure or vaccine to prevent HIV, a strong need exists to reduce long-term morbidity in HIV-infected individuals both by achieving viral suppression and limiting HIV- and/or ART-related complications, particularly since the current World Health Organization's guidelines recommend treating all HIV-infected individuals with ART and offering anti-retroviral drugs to at-risk persons for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).</p>    <p>This FOA supports mechanistic research as well as clinical studies examining the effects of HIV infection, including relevant host conditions, ART, or other HIV-related therapies on metabolic/endocrine function and metabolic/endocrine-related outcomes, as well as the effects of other therapies proposed to mitigate HIV and/or ART-related adverse metabolic/endocrine perturbations in the HIV population. Given the advances in ART and the transition of HIV-associated morbidity from one of primarily acute opportunistic infections and immune dysfunction to one having chronic metabolic and/or endocrine complications, it will be important for health care providers caring for HIV-infected individuals to use the appropriate ART to adequately achieve viral suppression while simultaneously limiting medication-related metabolic/endocrine dysfunction.</p>    <p>As an example, in the case of diabetes, more than 10 classes of glucose-lowering medications are currently available which have relative advantages and disadvantages based on individual patient characteristics. As such, research aimed to elucidate the characteristics of HIV-positive individuals with diabetes which might make certain glucose-lowering drugs more or less effective, or alter the risk of adverse effects, is important. Moreover, there is growing interest in the interaction of diabetes with HIV and Tuberculosis coinfection. As such, research aimed to better elucidate host-pathogen interactions in those individuals with diabetes co-infected with HIV/Tuberculosis is also important as it may inform new approaches to host-directed therapies.</p>    <p>It is hoped that studies adequately addressing these issues will greatly improve our knowledge of HIV- and ART-associated metabolic and endocrine perturbations and will yield new approaches for the prevention, management, and treatment of HIV- and ART-associated adipose tissue/lipodystrophic changes, as well as disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism and other HIV-associated metabolic and endocrine perturbations.

The infrastructure support will facilitate a collaborative research network through meetings, conferences, small-scale pilots, and dissemination activities to foster development and champion use of state-of-the-art definitions, uniform nomenclature, and validated approaches that will be key to the advancement of research on maintenance of brain and cognitive health and treatment and/or prevention of ADRD.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p>Although chronological age itself remains the strongest predictor of age-related cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and many forms of dementia including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), there appear to be protective factors against some or all of these outcomes whose mechanisms of protection are poorly understood, and which have been replicated inconsistently. Our lack of understanding may be the result of vague or conflicting definitions in the literature, whereas in others, the problem may lie in consistency of measurement. Moreover, although most of these factors are labeled as if there were a modifiable causal mechanism that could suggest important interventions or intervention strategies, it is likely that in some cases the causal arrow is reversed and the ""protective factor"" is essentially a signal of favorable genetic endowment. In still other cases, the factor may be modifiable, but the protection is due to early life experiences or exposures that cannot be recapitulated later in life. As a group, these factors usually have been described as imparting cognitive resilience to age-related changes in brain structure or neuropathology, building cognitive reserve to oppose age-related changes or frank pathology, or augmenting other types of cognitive function that would be beneficial. However, without greatly enhanced conceptual and definitional clarity concerning the concepts of cognitive reserve and resilience, or how we could conclusively establish that cognitive reserve or resilience were responsible for relatively favorable outcomes, we cannot make substantial progress in answering questions concerning what intervention strategies we could reasonably propose or how much benefit such interventions would provide.</p>    <p>Given the growth in the worldwide burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the continued failure of clinical trials, the focus on intervention at ever earlier disease stages, or for primary prevention in middle age or earlier, has sharpened. Past pathological research on autopsied brains coupled with more recent advances in neuroradiology have shown that a significant proportion of older adults have what should, by diagnostic criteria, be a clinically meaningful amount of AD neuropathology yet no detectable cognitive impairment. Furthermore, at least two U.S. groups have identified a small segment of the older population who appear to be cognitive ""super agers"" &ndash; adults 80 years and older with the cognitive performance of individuals 20-30 years younger. These discoveries point to the promise of factors in some individuals that may confer cognitive resilience and compensation, or exposures that lead to an accumulation of brain/cognitive reserve. With the current emphasis on identification of factors that assure cognitive/brain health in older adults and on prevention of or very early (preclinical) intervention for ADRD, the establishment of uniform definitions, nomenclature and approaches will accelerate progress.</p>    <p>In April 2017, the NIA with the support of the Foundation for NIH (FNIH) on behalf of the McKnight Brain Research Foundation (MBRF) conducted the Cognitive Aging Summit III, the specific focus of which was on the concepts of cognitive reserve and resilience. The Summit brought together a multidisciplinary group of investigators with shared interest in research on age-related cognitive decline as well as cognitive reserve and resilience, as compared to cognitive impairment or dementia. Nevertheless, the assembled investigators noted that there was no bright line between normal age-related cognitive decline and more clearly pathological processes, and in many (but not all) cases the possible mechanisms of resilience could be the same. There was unanimous agreement that a significant barrier to progress in the field was the lack of clear and universally accepted definitions of important concepts related to cognitive reserve and resilience and that it was imperative to address this deficit.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Scope</strong></div>    <p>This FOA will advance the field by establishing a collaboratory to develop operational definitions, uniform nomenclature, and validated approaches for cognitive reserve, cognitive resilience and related concepts.

The discovery of the viral etiology of AIDS, the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and public health initiatives targeted to preventing transmission, have changed HIV infection from a disease characterized by limited survival to a chronic illness. From the early days of the HIV epidemic, it was evident that HIV infection was a multisystem disease, affecting other organ systems in addition to the immune system. Organ system disease might result from exposure to the virus and/or viral peptides, from sequelae of superinfections, from host/viral interactions (including genetic susceptibility to discrete complications), or as has been demonstrated recently, from the metabolic dysfunction that often accompanies HAART. As people infected with HIV live longer, the chronic health consequences of the viral infection and its treatment have become paramount concerns for personal and public health.</p>    <p>This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) invites applications related to the broad fields of HIV infection, treatment, and long-term sequelae as they relate to the mission of the Division of Kidney, Urologic and Hematologic Diseases within NIDDK (KUH/NIDDK,&nbsp;<a href=""http://1.usa.gov/1yAEDsL"">http://1.usa.gov/1yAEDsL</a>) and seeks applications that propose to evaluate the long-term effects of HAART on the kidney, genitourinary system, erythrocyte biology and hematopoiesis; to define organ disease progression trajectories as a result of HIV infection and treatment and define prediction models for susceptibility to organ disease; to define the interplay between underlying genetic susceptibility to organ disease and HIV infection and treatment; to discover and validate appropriate biomarkers for organ disease progression; and to conduct population-based studies of organ disease in HIV-infected and treated populations. The Division is additionally interested in applications proposing to further elucidate mechanisms of HIV persistence and transmission in the male genital tract.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Research Objectives</strong></p>    <p>Specifically, proposed research projects may include, but are not limited to:</p>    <p><em>HIV and renal disease</em></p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Long-term nephrotoxicity of HAART</li>    <li>Interplay between ApoL1 susceptibility variants and HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) and HIV-associated immune-complex kidney disease</li>    <li>Development of risk prediction models of chronic renal disease as a result of HIV infection and/or treatment</li>    <li>Ascertainment and validation of biomarkers for HIVAN and subsequent renal insufficiency or failure</li>    <li>Population-based research to develop and promote dissemination of effective surveillance practices and interventions to mitigate renal disease in HIV-infected individuals</li>    <li>Epidemiology of CKD and ESRD in HIV-infected populations</li>    <li>Renal sequelae of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) related to HIV infection</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><em>HIV and urologic disease</em></p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Characterization and molecular biology of immunomodulatory factors that facilitate or prevent HIV infection in the male genital tract</li>    <li>Cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the &ldquo;circumcision effect&rdquo; on suppression of HIV transmission</li>    <li>Interplay between endogenous penile microflora or acquired genital tract infectious agents in HIV transmission</li>    <li>Cellular and molecular characterization of the HIV reservoirs in the male genital tract, with particular interest in prostate and seminal vesicles</li>    <li>Effect of steroid hormones on endogenous HIV reservoirs in the male genital tract</li>    <li>Interplay of HIV infection and comorbid male genital tract infections (prostatitis, for example), in HIV viral load and transmissibility</li>    <li>Development of novel clinical approaches to eradicate HIV from the male genital tract</li>    <li>Cellular and molecular characterization of the effects of HIV infection on bladder physiology and pathophysiology</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><em>HIV and hematological disease</em></p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Mechanism of HIV infection on the impairment or suppression of normal blood cell development</li>    <li>Identification of cell surface marker changes associated with HIV infection or changes in susceptibility to infection of blood cells during hematopoiesis;</li>    <li>Ascertainment of infection susceptibility of exogenous hematopoietic cells (e.g. from cord blood or mobilized peripheral blood) with respect to HIV susceptibility</li>    <li>HIV infection of cells in the bone marrow niche</li>    <li>Systems biology approaches to investigate HIV infected versus non-infected blood cells</li>    <li>Investigations proposing to examine the pathophysiology of HIV within the female reproductive tract would not be responsive to this FOA.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>Awardees will meet yearly in Bethesda, MD to present project progress and experimental findings to NIDDK program staff and collaborators.&nbsp; The intent of the annual meeting is to provide a forum for exchange of emerging data and ideas in order to expedite research advances.</p>"12261,Grant,"Research on Smoking Cessation and Reduction <p>The Foundation for a Smoke-Free World is launching two online processes to inform and guide the Foundation&rsquo;s long-term research initiatives. The first is a public comment period to solicit input on research priorities. The second is a call for letters of intent for early scoping grants that will help assess areas of research with the greatest potential to accelerate the end of smoking. Researchers, policy makers, smokers and others with relevant experience or expertise are invited to contribute.</p>    <p><strong>Scoping Grants</strong></p>    <p>Since the Foundation&rsquo;s formation, its leadership has been listening to and engaging with public health experts from around the world in a variety of forums, including conferences, one-on-one meetings and a Foundation-hosted research symposium. Through these discussions and experiences, it became apparent that some potential areas of research exploration will need more detailed scoping and development before the Foundation issues large-scale requests for research proposals in 2018.</p>    <p>To prepare for the launch of an aggressive set of research programs in 2018, the Foundation is now accepting letters of intent for early scoping grants to gather more information on potential research topics related to smoking cessation, harm reduction and alternative livelihoods for tobacco farmers.

The UG3/UH3 phases should use primary human tissues to help characterize both the maturity and adult function of iPSC-derived tissues, and by the end of the UG3 period, should have significant progress towards generating at least two multicellular liver, islet, skeletal muscle and/or WAT chips, all using an iPSC cell source.&nbsp; The UH3 phase will support studies to improve and validate the individual tissue chips and on-chip assays, add immune elements, and to physically integrate the chips with each other. &nbsp;Features that are essential for the development of models of insulin resistance/inflammation/type 2 diabetes should be included.&nbsp; A UG3 project that meets its milestones will be administratively considered by the NIDDK and other participating ICs and prioritized for transition to the UH3 award.&nbsp; Applicants responding to this FOA must address objectives for both the UG3 and UH3 phases.</p>    <p><strong>Background</strong></p>    <p>Currently, in diabetes research,&nbsp;<em>in vivo</em>&nbsp;animal models serve as gold standards for advancement to clinical trials, but the drawbacks associated with such models are major contributors to the costs and uncertainties in therapy development.&nbsp; Because of the interspecies differences, animal models often fail to recapitulate many aspects of human physiology.&nbsp; To address these concerns, NIDDK has identified a critical need to develop new pre-clinical model systems to study normal human physiology and metabolism of the pancreatic islet, and, in 2014, created the Consortium on Human Islet Biomimetics (CHIB)&nbsp;<a href=""https://hirnetwork.org/consortium/chib"">https://hirnetwork.org/consortium/chib</a>.&nbsp; CHIB&rsquo;s goals are to derive a bioengineered human islet that can maintain a functional, healthy adult human beta cell phenotype for a period of up to 4 weeks,&nbsp;<em>in vitro</em>.&nbsp; The CHIB teams are working to build a pancreatic biomimetic that combines several salient features: cadaveric human islets or islets created from a human pluripotent stem cell source, 3D cytoarchitecture, and recreation of a human islet niche with integrated vasculature, ECM, innervation and/or soluble factors.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong><em>Remaining Challenges facing MPS-based diabetes modeling:</em></strong></p>    <p><strong><em>Human pancreas:</em></strong>&nbsp;Producing an appropriately engineered platform that both recapitulates the microenvironment of the islet, and better mimics the complex structure and physiology of the islet, are important features for maintaining pancreatic beta cell health.&nbsp; The development of robust, reproducible, and sensitive methods of on-chip monitoring of islet function (such as dynamic insulin secretion has proven challenging and is an ongoing research activity in CHIB.&nbsp; Although the human islet biomimetic effort is well underway, a remaining challenge will be to develop efficient and reproducible protocols to generate and combine the different cellular subtypes of the islet (such as alpha cells secreting glucagon).&nbsp; Incorporating islet vasculature, and other cellular components of the niche using an isogenic iPSC cell source, and addressing on-chip oxygen demand is also critical.</p>    <p><strong><em>Human liver:&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;Recent advances have demonstrated the feasibility of generating vascularized and complex liver buds (<em>ex-vivo</em>) by combining cells generated from multiple human cell sources, including iPSC derivatives.&nbsp; However, a major drawback to the liver chips generated from an iPSC cell source, is that these liver organoids are fetal-like in nature, and do not fully re-capitulate adult function,&nbsp;<em>in vitro</em>. Furthermore, the cellular components used to generate these liver organoids combine a diverse group of starting cell sources, and for modeling a complex metabolic disease such as diabetes, this is not ideal.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong><em>Human adipose:</em></strong>&nbsp;There are emerging protocols for creating WAT from human pluripotent sources and primary tissue sources along with development of vascularized organoids and distinct ECM. The creation of a WAT engineered platform utilizing an isogenic iPSC source needs to be developed in conjunction with on-chip, validated assays of metabolic function such insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, adipokine secretion, lipid storage and oxidation capacities, and ultimately to demonstrate the plasticity of human WAT (such as ""beiging"") in response to cold or hormonal stimulation.</p>    <p><strong>Incorporating immune components</strong>: Modeling how the immune system influences tissue function and pathophysiology using MPS-based platforms remains very challenging, but initial studies are showing some promise. Given the central role of inflammation in many chronic disease states, and the strong links between inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, a key goal of this initiative will be to provide systems that not only model normal organ physiology, but that also model interactions between the immune system and these MPS-based tissues under normal and pathophysiologic conditions.</p>    <p><strong><em>The Tissues-on-Chips Consortium (The TC Consortium)</em></strong>&nbsp;is led and managed by NCATS and utilizes expertise (organ physiology, regulatory science, stem cells, bioengineering, etc.) from experts representing many institutes (including NIDDK), Centers and Offices at the NIH and the FDA. (<a href=""http://www.ncats.nih.gov/research/reengineering/tissue-chip/tissue-chip.html"">http://www.ncats.nih.gov/research/reengineering/tissue-chip/tissue-chip.html</a>&nbsp;) This program supports an innovative approach to preclinical toxicity testing on human tissue: development of in vitro, three-dimensional organ systems from human cells on bioengineered platforms that mimic in vivo tissue architecture and physiological conditions in order to facilitate and accurately monitor key organ-level functions.&nbsp; The program has made substantial advances in developing multiple human tissue chips that can be physically integrated, and be used for drug/toxicity testing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The newly funded effort of the TC Consortium is to develop translatable&nbsp;<em>in vitro</em>&nbsp;models for preclinical efficacy studies, however, the pancreatic islet, liver, and WAT, as well as immune cell components are missing from this effort. This FOA supports the development of tissue chips from these ""missing tissues"".&nbsp; In keeping with the goals of the TC Consortium, once the iPSC-derived human islet, liver, and WAT chips are developed fully and tested for the ability of these systems to measure inflammation-driven pathophysiology, the next phase will be to generate an integrated micro system platform that can incorporate a bimodal, or multimodal biomimetic system and can be used to model aspects of a complex metabolic disease such as type 2 diabetes.&nbsp; The UH3 phase will therefore support studies to increase the complexity of the MPS-based models generated in the UG3 phase. It is expected that projects that progress to the UH3 phase will be focused on advancing 3 key aspects of MPS-MOD development: (1) linking multiple platforms together to measure crosstalk between metabolic tissues, (2) expanding the types and representation of immune cells in each of the organ-based systems, and (3) validating the utility of these systems to serve as experimental platforms for testing known diabetes drugs such as metformin, as well as, new and novel therapeutic strategies that preserve beta cell, adipocyte and hepatocyte functions and ameliorate diabetes.</p>    <p><strong>Research Objectives and Scope</strong></p>    <p>Applicants are invited to participate in a coordinated research effort focused on developing MPS to model human diabetes.&nbsp; Work will combine advances in stem cell biology, with the technological opportunities in tissue engineering that have led to the generation of microdevices that support aspects of functional, living organs. Applications should : 1) establish rigorous and reproducible protocols for the derivation of the pancreatic islet, liver, skeletal muscle, WAT, and/or immune system from a single isogenic iPSC source, 2) develop MPS platforms to support normal physiological function of the pancreatic islet, liver, skeletal muscle, and WAT, 3) develop &ldquo;on-chip&rdquo; functional assays that can offer quantitative, real-time monitoring, 3) integrate the human islet, liver, skeletal muscle and WAT tissue modules to establish models that feature the metabolic hallmarks of insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes, and 4) validate these models with known biomarkers and therapeutic agents of diabetes.</p>    <p>To be responsive to this FOA, all projects must develop at least two individual platforms for the human pancreatic islet, liver, skeletal muscle and/or WAT and must incorporate expertise needed to incorporate inflammatory components into the systems. Other relevant tissue chips for diabetes modeling may be added during the UH3 phase.</p>    <p>The MPS for the human pancreatic islet, liver, skeletal muscle and WAT are expected to individually re-create critical aspects of human physiology and provide measurable outputs for the representative system.&nbsp; Essential characteristics of the MPS should include all or some of the following features: 1) multicellular 3D architecture that represents characteristics of the tissues or organs; 2) models that closely mimic the normal physiology and can recapitulate tissue crosstalk between the pancreatic islet, liver, skeletal muscle and WAT; 3) reproducible and viable operation under physiological conditions maintained for up to 4 weeks in culture.&nbsp; Ideally, the platforms should provide spatial and temporal control of the cellular microenvironment, while enabling continuous monitoring (sensing), probing (direct in-cell measurements), and sampling (testing and continuous data collection and analysis) of the system. The primary focus of the UG3 phase will be to develop robust and reproducible protocols for generating an individual human iPSC-derived islet, liver, muscle, or WAT, that will accommodate the incorporation of tissue-resident immune populations and/or trafficking of immune cells within the tissue structure. The ultimate goal of the MPS-MOD program will be to produce multicellular platforms comprised of complex cell types that recapitulate key features of mature, adult-like function, whose components are derived from a single isogenic line, and to develop sensitive and reproducible assays for monitoring metabolic function and inflammatory-driven metabolic dysfunction.

The estimated number has increased greatly from 1.8 million since 1999 which does not include children who may be affected by IBD as well. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two common types of IBD that are characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Some common symptoms include persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloody stools, weight loss, and fatigue. The exact cause of IBD is not well understood. Genetic predisposition and environmental triggers may play a role. Additionally, diagnosis of IBD is not a straightforward process. A series of blood and stool tests, endoscopies, radiology scans or diagnostic imaging are usually performed to make a diagnosis of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.<br /><br />IBD is usually a lifetime chronic condition. The severity and progression of the disease largely impacts patients' quality of life through the ongoing symptoms. Furthermore, the disease also causes complications and is related to other comorbidities. For instance, hospitalization rate for Crohn's disease increased significantly when it was listed as a primary or any secondary diagnosis indicated by the ICD-9 diagnosis codes.</p>    <p>IBD is known to be more prevalent among the white population. However, incidence and prevalence of IBD is increasing among minorities. Trends of hospitalizations showed that a discharge diagnosis of IBD increased from 1994 to 2006 among non-white populations in the US, which may suggest an increase of IBD burden among minorities. In addition, geographic variation was also detected in the prevalence of IBD for both children and adults. In a previous study reported by Kappelman et al, the prevalence of IBD was lower in the South and West compared to the rest of the U.S. regions. Geographic variation is usually associated with racial and ethnic disparity of disease detection and management . Understanding the racial difference in the prevalence of IBD helps elucidate the socio-environmental and genetic attributes related to the disease, as well as inform health policies aimed at addressing disparities in healthcare access.</p>    <p>Through this announcement, CDC seeks research proposals aimed at expanding knowledge of demographic and clinical characteristics of IBD in the general population. It is important to recruit minority races and ethnicities in the new IBD registry as the information in the current literature is fragmented. Comparing the clinical outcomes involving non-Hispanic white and other races and ethnicities helps understand genetic and socio-environmental factors accounting for the disease. Furthermore, although IBD is an uncommon disease, it imposes a huge financial burden to the US healthcare system resulting from the outcomes of the disease. For instance, the total annual direct costs attributable to Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in the US are estimated to be between $11 billion to $28 billion [10]. To address the important public health problem, the research findings will provide a better understanding of etiology of the disease, identify high-risk populations, help improve healthcare access among IBD patients, and inform better clinical practice.</p>    <p>This research will augment previous epidemiologic studies of IBD, by establishing and maintaining a surveillance program to obtain incidence of IBD, describing the natural history and outcomes of the disease, and assessing impact of IBD on minorities and affected people. This NOFO is to address establishment and use of an IBD registry for conducting populationbased studies. The project goals will be achieved by collecting patients' demographic and clinical data, extrapolating incidence to the U.S. population, disseminating study findings through peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, training programs, and fact sheets.</p>    <p>The purpose of this research is to:</p>    <ul>    <li>Establish a new IBD registry to estimate incidence of IBD in the adult and pediatric populations from the IBD registry and extrapolate to the US population.</li>    <li>Describe natural history and outcomes of IBD.</li>    <li>Determine racial/ethnic variation in the detection and management of IBD.</li>    <li>Identify evidence-based strategies to improve disease outcomes.</li>    <li>Disseminate study findings to medical professionals, researchers, and public health practitioners</li>    </ul>"12358,Grant,"Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE)     <div class=""heading4""><strong>Background and Objectives</strong></div>    <p>The COBRE program seeks to promote the initiation and development or expansion of unique, innovative state-of-the-art biomedical and behavioral research centers at institutions in IDeA-eligible states.

Other main barriers identified include health policies, competing priorities, high operating costs or a lack of data regarding cost effectiveness, and a lack of telecommunications infrastructure (specific to low income countries).

In 2002, the NIH advanced strategic plans to counter threats presented by emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. A significant component of these plans was the NIAID Regional Centers of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research (RCE) program, which enabled appropriate infrastructure and multifaceted research and development activities to provide scientific information and translational research capacity to facilitate discovery and development of the next generation of therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics. In 2014, NIAID transitioned the RCE program to the CETR program to facilitate innovative, interdisciplinary translational research efforts focused on countermeasure and/or related platform development.

NIAID anticipates considerable variety among Center themes and objectives, which can range from the development of single or multiple countermeasures targeting a specific group of listed pathogens/toxins to the development of new technologies or platforms that target a wide array of pathogens/toxins. Translational activities are anticipated to range from very early discovery-based efforts to late-stage preclinical development with industrial participation.

In 2014, the CDC issued guidelines for the use of PrEP for men who have sex with men, heterosexual adults, and injection drug users at high risk of HIV infection. When used consistently, oral PrEP has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection through sexual contact in people at high risk by over 90%. PrEP requires daily use and medical follow-up visits every 3 months. PrEP does not protect other sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia or gonorrhea or against pregancy. PrEP can be quite costly if paid for out of pocket. While prescriptions and medical visits/lab fees are generally covered by insurance, co-pays or deductibles may pose financial barriers for some individuals. Financial assistance is available from Gilead, the maker of Truvada, and some state and local programs are available to provide PrEP free or at reduced cost.</p>    <p>Because the use of PrEP has only recently been established as an evidence-based HIV prevention practice, much of the existing research on PrEP has focused on understanding its mechanisms of action, establishing efficacy, and examining the impact of dosing schedules on adherence and effectiveness. PrEP utilization has been examined in controlled trials and demonstration projects where PrEP is administered free of charge with regular monitoring. Much less research has occurred in practice settings in the US to understand the patterns of PrEP access, availability, adherence. Some early research indicates the presence of racial/ethnic and SES disparities regarding PrEP. Racial/ethnic minorities and low SES populations are less likely to be aware of PrEP as an option or know how to obtain it, and when prescribed PrEP, are less likely to be adherent. Although new HIV infections occur disproportionately in young men of color, current PrEP users are disproportionately non-Hispanic White older men, even when access barriers are minimized.</p>    <p>More research is needed to understand how to maximize the potential of PrEP as an HIV prevention strategy for health disparity populations with elevated HIV risk. A better understanding of the reasons for low use of PrEP among health disparity populations is necessary for effective interventions to be developed. Research gaps with health disparity populations include systematic examination of PrEP attitudes, access, availability, and adherence; the impact of PrEP use on HIV and STI risk behavior (e.g., condom use, serostatus/PrEP disclosure, partner selection, STI testing, etc.) or contraceptive use; clinician, community, and policy-level factors that impact PrEP initiation and adherence; and PrEP use among US women, among whom PrEP use is very low.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives</strong></div>    <p>This initiative will support community- or healthcare-based research projects that examine PrEP attitudes, use, and adherence in one or more NIH-designated health disparity populations, which include Blacks/African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asians, Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities. Projects may address multiple health disparity populations, a single health disparity population, or a specific group within a health disparity population. Inclusion of segments of health disparity populations at the highest risk of HIV infection (e.g., young men who have sex with men, transwomen, incarcerated populations, etc.) is strongly encouraged.</p>    <p>Projects may involve quantitative and/or qualitative data collection and/or secondary analysis of existing data. Projects are encouraged to involve collaborations with a variety of organizations as relevant, including but not limited to academic institutions, clinician groups, healthcare systems, state and local public health agencies, school systems, patient advocacy organizations, community-based organizations, and faith-based organizations.

As with the prior MEPI programmatic and linked awards, these awards emphasize the critical importance of research in creating vibrant and effective schools for health professional education that can improve health on the continent.</p>    <p>HEPI will build on the achievements and lessons learned from MEPI and NEPI by further enhancing educational and research programs, as well as partnerships and networks, formed by prior MEPI and NEPI support and/or by expanding to new Health Professional Schools and departments.&nbsp; Prior participation in MEPI or NEPI awards is not required.</p>    <p>Special Considerations: Examples of potential activities are provided in five areas, each of which should be addressed in the application.&nbsp; Different applicant institutions will be at different stages of building their health professions education and research capacity, so it is expected that different applicants will give different weight to each of these areas, depending on their needs. These are examples only and each applicant should consider the specific activities that will best help their institutions address the over-arching goal and major objectives stated above.</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li><a class=""Bullet"" name=""_Hlk498952925""></a><strong><em>Courses for Skills Development:</em></strong>&nbsp;For example, innovative, hands-on community-based training, problem-based learning, inter-professional practicums, and clinical preceptorships; advanced courses in clinical procedures, simulations, new technologies, or specialized clinical and research techniques; training in core capabilities for institutional support of research (such as ethical review, grants management, and financial management); videocast and interactive grand rounds and seminar series. Skills training may take the form of practicums, short or long courses, workshops, summer institutes, and eLearning.&nbsp; Priority should be given to courses that address HIV/AIDS topics such as- but not limited to- stigma and discrimination, nurse initiated and managed ART (NIMART), data management and use for decision-making, and quality improvement of HIV/AIDS service delivery. Participants may also be sent to partner institutions for specialized skills development not available at the grantee institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>    <li><strong><em>Research Experiences:</em></strong>&nbsp;Research experiences must be an integral part of the educational program with expectations for high quality, scientifically rigorous, mentored research that might impact health practice in the associated field.

The program is expected to have four stages: a set-up phase in FY18, a scale-up phase in FY19-21, a production phase in FY22-24 and a transition phase in FY25. The five research initiatives that compose the program are:</p>    <ul>    <li><strong>Transformative Technology Development</strong>&nbsp;- This set of initiatives, the first of which will be issued FY18, seeks to establish proof of principle and validation of the next generation of tools, techniques and methods that will be foundational for mapping the human body at high resolution.</li>    <li><strong>Rapid Technology Integration</strong>&nbsp;- This set of initiatives, which is expected to start in FY19 pending the availability of funds, will focus on nimble integration of promising imaging and omics technologies into HuBMAP that have the potential to enhance data collection and validation during the program, and expanding throughput, multiplexing or discrimination of different classes of biomolecules.</li>    <li><strong>Tissue Mapping Centers</strong>&nbsp;- These Centers, which will be initially funded in FY18, will build, benchmark, standardize, validate and generate extensive data from high-content, high-throughput imaging and omics technologies to produce 3D human tissue maps at high resolution.

Despite vastly improved imaging and omics technologies and many important foundational discoveries, our understanding of how tissues are organized is restricted to a very limited number of microscopic structures. Better insights into the principles governing organization-function relationship will potentially lead to better understanding of the significance of inter-individual variability, changes across the lifespan, tissue engineering, and the emergence of disease at the biomolecular level. However, integrating imaging and omics analysis to comprehensively profile biomolecular distribution and morphology of tissues in a high throughput manner and placing this information into 3D tissue maps amenable to modelling has yet to be fully realized.</p>    <p>In a&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:https://www.commonfund.nih.gov/sites/default/files/HuBMAP%20Summary%20of%20Planning%20Meeting.docx"">June 2016 meeting organized by the NIH</a>, experts from the research community identified the following scientific priorities necessary to develop these tissue maps : 1) sourcing high quality tissue from multiple human normal organ sites, 2) processing and preserving tissue for multiple imaging and omics assays, 3) quality control, validation and variation in data generation, 4) data coordination across multiple acquisition techniques, 5) annotation, curation and archiving of the data, 6) browsing, visualizing and searching the data, 7) building statistical and analytic techniques and models for nonlinear analysis of highly multidimensional data and 8) community engagement.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Objectives and Scope for the Transformative Technology Development Projects</strong></div>    <p>This Transformative Technology Development (TTD) FOA seeks to establish the next generation of tools, techniques and methods that will be foundational for mapping the human body with high resolution that provide information not available using current technologies and techniques. Successful projects will develop, demonstrate and validate transformative technologies that can generate extensive, quantitative data on biomolecular distribution in tissues to produce comprehensive 3D tissue maps. Applications are expected: (1) to be high impact with thoughtfully managed risk, (2) to use a milestone-driven engineering approach that considers design, testing and evaluation, and (3) to bring together multi-disciplinary teams that will iteratively design technologies that can be rapidly disseminated for wider use by the HuBMAP Consortium. By the end of the UG3 phase, the goal is to have successful proof-of-principle demonstrations of innovative technologies that can more comprehensively map the distribution of biomolecules in mammalian tissues. All technologies are expected to be capable of quantitatively and reproducibly measuring the distribution of a large number of biomolecules in the intra-, inter- and extra-cellular spaces of mammalian tissue, independent of what species it came from. By the end of the UH3 phase the goals is to have optimized, scaled, benchmarked and successfully validated technologies that have been used to generate publication-quality data from multiple non-diseased human tissues. The complementary Rapid Technology Integration (RTI) initiatives will support integration of technologies at this stage of development into the Tissue Mapping Centers. Applicants with published results showing proof-of-principle in mammalian tissues are strongly encouraged to wait until for the RTI initiative, which is planned for release in FY19.</p>    <p class=""Heading4Indent""><strong>Research Focus</strong></p>    <p>This FOA is intended to support the accelerated development of novel in situ imaging and omics approaches that have the potential to transform 3D human tissue mapping, such as new approaches in single cell proteomics and phosphoproteomics, methylomics and other epigenomic assays, metabolomics, glycomics or multi-parameter analysis. These technologies must offer capabilities of analyzing tissue significantly beyond those in peer-reviewed publications and must be generalizable and comprehensive enough to provide analysis of a large number of biomolecules of interest across all major human tissues. This FOA encourages, but is not limited to, technologies that can address the following challenges:</p>    <ul>    <li>Improving the specificity of biomolecules that can be robustly identified in tissues, by developing assays capable of distinguishing functionally-relevant modifications of RNA or proteins in situ;</li>    <li>Improving the range of biomolecules that can be robustly identified in tissues, by developing assays capable of unbiased, sensitive and specific analysis of the epigenome, methylome, metabolome, and/or proteome and glycoproteome at high resolution;</li>    <li>Overcoming trade-offs between spatial resolution, volume and analysis time to enable multi-parameter mapping of RNA and protein expression in three dimensions across whole organs;</li>    <li>Significantly improving the identification of biologically-relevant, biomolecular tissue features by multiplexed, simultaneous measures of diverse, though related, biomolecules such as metabolites proteins and glycoproteins;</li>    <li>Significantly improving throughput by more than one order of magnitude, using techniques such s adaptive, sparse sampling, deep learning or lens-free imaging.</li>    </ul>    <p>HuBMAP projects will generate high resolution, high content, high-throughput biomolecular data to generate 3D tissue maps of non-diseased human organs and organ systems. For HuBMAP,&nbsp;<strong><em>a high-resolution assay</em></strong>&nbsp;is one that can reliably and reproducibly assign detected biomolecules to individual cells or extracellular compartments of a tissue. A high content approach is one that maximizes identification of tissues features through a combination of biomolecular depth, spatial resolution and multiplexing of complementary, multi-parameter assays. A high throughput pipeline is one that maximizes the bandwidth of data production to result in any or all of the following: 1) accelerated speed of analysis, so that hundreds or thousands of samples can be analyzed at once, 2) greater depth of analysis, so that hundreds or thousands of molecules can be analyzed in a single sample, or 3) enhanced capacity for volume, so that a given set of molecules can be analyzed in all the cells within a larger tissue sample. Approaches that maximize the volume of tissue that will be analyzed while maintaining cellular resolution and high biomolecular content are strongly encouraged.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Given the focus of HuBMAP, proposed technologies must be capable of defining location at high resolution, provide comprehensive insight into the distribution of multiple biomolecules, have the potential to be included into the data production pipelines of HuBMAP's Tissue Mapping Centers, and support analysis of multiple human tissues. Although the focus of these projects should be on in-situ analysis of tissues, it is expected that unbiased, dissociative techniques can be used to inform development and validation. It is expected that projects that propose initial development using dissociated cells have a rapid and robust plan to establish feasibility in tissue within the UG3 phase. Projects that have not demonstrated successful analysis of cells in situ by the end of the UG3 phase will not progress to the UH3 phase.</p>    <p>If successful, the data from these projects may provide new insights into functional states, such as quiescence and senescence; cell-cell, neighborhood and system-wide signaling; chronobiology; and how changes in tissue organization impact function across the lifespan and the health-disease continuum.</p>    <p class=""Bullet""><strong>Applications addressing the following topics will be deemed non-responsive and will not be reviewed:</strong></p>    <ul>    <li>Projects primarily focused on the pursuit of a biological mechanism through basic research that does not result in an innovative technology that will significantly improve our capabilities to spatially map human tissues;</li>    <li>Projects proposing technologies that cannot be easily scaled for comprehensive analysis of multiple human tissues or that cannot be multiplexed with other assays;</li>    <li>Projects that do not propose methods that provide spatial information regarding the organization of cellular and non-cellular tissue components;</li>    <li>Projects proposing to primarily study fluids or dissociated cells;</li>    <li>Projects with published results demonstrating proof-of-principle for the proposed technology using mammalian tissue;</li>    <li>Projects that do not propose a feasible strategy to analyze mammalian tissue during the UG3 phase and non-diseased human tissue during the UH3 phase.</li>    </ul>    <p class=""Heading4Indent""><strong>Coordination and Collaboration</strong></p>    <p>Successful applicants to this FOA will become members of the larger HuBMAP Consortium composed of investigators who have been funded in response to at least one of HuBMAP FOAs. The purpose of the Consortium is to enable groups to effectively collaborate with each other to maximize the chances of overall success of the program. In addition to completing the research goals outlined in their applications, successful applicants will be expected to work collaboratively with all members of the Consortium to contribute to developing SOPs, data and metadata standards, metrics for data generation, participate in cross-site studies, engage in cross-training, and guide development of data analysis and visualization tools that can be used by the broader scientific community. A Steering Committee (SC) composed of all the funded principal investigators and NIH staff will develop and implement Consortium policies, and guide overall direction of the Consortium to meet the goals of the program. This Steering Committee will meet regularly and be complemented by an Executive Committee and a set of working groups. NIH staff will also recruit outside experts (non-awardees) as External Program Consultants (EPCs) to provide advice directly to NIH.</p>    <p>The TTD projects will be strongly encouraged to work closely with the other projects of the HuBMAP to demonstrate how their technologies can be integrated and scaled for production of multiple tissue maps across the human body. Thus, the TTDs are expected to work closely together with the Tissue Mapping Centers (TMCs) to develop consortium-wide best practices for emerging approaches to data generation, carryout cross-site comparisons and test and validate technologies as applied to multiple tissues. They will also work closely with the HIVE to develop data and metadata standards for emerging technologies, to build calibration and validation datasets and engage in cross-site collaborations. It is envisaged that successful TTDs may transition to the Rapid Technology Integration initiative later during the program providing a pipeline for the comprehensive validation and integration of these innovative technologies into the TMCs. All HuBMAP investigators will also be required to attend the initial Kickoff meeting in Fall 2018, the annual HuBMAP investigator meetings, regular teleconferences with Consortium members and NIH Staff for the duration of the funding cycle. Although the Consortium-wide activities are yet to be defined, it is strongly recommended that the TTD projects plan and budget for collaboration activities as part of their applications.</p>    <p>NIH intends that the products of the TTDs be broadly available to establish the foundations for a human body map that other programs and the community could build upon; this includes methods, tools, reagents, biospecimens, datasets, and software.

During the UH3, projects are expected to demonstrate that the performance of the technology can be benchmarked and enhanced, confirm that this performance can be reproduced with non-diseased human tissue compare the results with complementary assays.</p>    <p>Because transformative technology development is an inherently high-risk high-reward process, it is anticipated that there may be significant attrition as projects move through development and validation. Projects that successfully reach the goals of the UG3 phase will be administratively reviewed, with priority projects proceeding to the UH3 phase pending availability of funds. Investigators responding to this FOA must develop a strategy for both UG3 and UH3 phases in this application. Funded UG3 projects will be asked for an updated strategy prior to the UH3 administrative review, although this does not imply funding for the UH3 phase.</p>    <p>As a cooperative agreement and as part of the HuBMAP Consortium, projects should focus on how their proposed project meets the goals of the program, how they significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art, how they can be integrated with other technologies, and how they are capable of being scaled to map multiple human tissues in a high-throughput fashion. Applications should include discussion of performance, dynamic range, sensitivity and specificity of their technologies; calibration and control processes; testing, evaluation and improvement; and interoperability and usability. Projects are strongly encouraged to have ambitious goals and annual milestones. Milestones are goals that are quantifiable for measuring success that can be used for go/no-go decision-making for the project, and should include quantitative criteria associated with them. Prior to funding an application, NIH program staff will contact the applicant to discuss the proposed milestones and any changes suggested by the review panel or NIH program staff.&nbsp; A final set of milestones will be specified each year in the Notice of Award.

Components of trial readiness may include knowledge of the course of disease necessary for selecting cohorts of patients with defined characteristics, and validation of clinical outcome measures or biomarkers appropriate for assessing response to the intervention.&nbsp; By supporting studies aimed at clinical trial readiness, the NINDS intends to accelerate the testing of candidate therapeutics and increase the likelihood of successful trials.&nbsp;</p>    <p class=""Heading4Indent""><strong>Background</strong></p>    <p>The NINDS supports basic, translational and clinical research on a broad range of diseases that are defined as rare (fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S.).&nbsp; To optimize the design of clinical trials for these diseases, there needs to be sufficient understanding of the presentation and course of the disease.&nbsp; Furthermore, tools to select appropriate participants for the trial and to measure the effects of interventions must be sensitive, reliable, valid and responsive.&nbsp; These tools include clinical outcome assessment (COA) measures (including clinical scales and composite measures) and biomarkers (diagnostic, prognostic, predictive, pharmacodynamic or others).&nbsp; COA measures include clinician-, observer- and patient-reported outcome measures, and quantitative performance outcome measures.&nbsp; A biomarker can be a laboratory measurement of the concentration of biomolecule in a patient&rsquo;s tissue or fluids, or it can be a measurable feature of the patient&rsquo;s tissues or organs that is informative of structure, composition or physiological functioning.&nbsp; Prior to launching clinical efficacy studies, however, sufficient testing is required to demonstrate that the assays and the biomarkers themselves are sensitive, reliable, and appropriate for use in future clinical trials.&nbsp; Without sufficient knowledge of the disease and suitable measurement tools, clinical trials may be inconclusive or misleading.&nbsp; For some of the rare diseases within the mission of NINDS, preclinical translational research has advanced and candidate therapeutics are currently being developed, but clinical trial readiness may be lagging.&nbsp; For these diseases, additional studies are needed to collect data essential for the design of clinical trials or to prepare research tools for use in trials.</p>    <p>The FDA has recently published&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM458485.pdf"">Draft Guidance</a>&nbsp;on common issues in drug development for rare diseases.&nbsp; This FOA is intended to support studies that address some of the issues in this guidance document including the needs for adequate understanding of the course of the disease, and reliable endpoints and outcome measures.&nbsp;</p>    <p class=""Heading4Indent""><strong>Scope</strong></p>    <p>This FOA is intended to support clinical studies that address current obstacles to the design of upcoming clinical trials in rare neurological and neuromuscular diseases and conditions.&nbsp; The studies supported through this FOA should be clinical observational studies (cross-sectional or longitudinal), and no intervention studies will be supported through this FOA.&nbsp; Appropriate trial readiness projects can be &ldquo;stand-alone&rdquo; studies, or they can be ancillary to other, ongoing clinical studies.&nbsp; For example, a project could propose to validate new or improved COA measures or biomarkers by adding them as experimental outcomes in an ongoing trial or longitudinal study that is supported through other funding sources.&nbsp; Higher priority will be given to diseases/conditions that currently or soon will have multiple candidate therapeutics or devices ready for testing in clinical trials, but that lack critical components of trial readiness that are needed for moving forward.&nbsp; For these higher priority diseases, the justification should be made by the applicants that clinical trials could begin immediately after the completion of the trial readiness study to test the candidate therapeutics that will be available at that time.&nbsp; Disorders will be given lower priority if there is not a strong justification for the urgent need for trial readiness, based on the likelihood of available candidate therapeutics by the time the trial readiness study would be completed.&nbsp; Lower priority will also be given to diseases or conditions for which clinical trials are already ongoing, and advances in clinical trial design through more sensitive or reliable biomarkers or COA measures, or better characterization of disease cohorts would not significantly accelerate progress toward effective treatments.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Because of the limited number of patients with specific rare diseases or conditions available at any one clinical site, clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of candidate interventions often utilize networks or consortia of clinical sites with experience interacting with those patients.&nbsp; The consistent and reproducible use of validated COA measures or biomarkers at multiple clinical sites is essential for clinical trial success.&nbsp; Therefore, prior to planning a multi-site trial, it may be necessary to conduct a multi-site trial readiness study to determine whether COA measures or biomarkers are &ldquo;fit for purpose&rdquo; and whether it is feasible to collect the data under conditions expected for the upcoming trial.&nbsp; This FOA is intended to support clinical studies aimed at verifying that candidate COAs or biomarkers are suitable for use in upcoming multi-site clinical trials.&nbsp; If only single-site clinical trials are anticipated (e.g., the condition is so rare that all patients are seen at one site), it would be appropriate to conduct the clinical trial readiness study at that one site.&nbsp; However, this may be an unusual situation, and awards from this FOA are likely to support multi-site studies.</p>    <p>Applications to this FOA may propose studies to address gaps in knowledge regarding clinical presentation or progression of rare diseases that must be filled before planning for clinical trials.&nbsp; Such cohort characterization studies may be needed, for example, to determine trial eligibility criteria or to determine a stage of disease progression when the response to treatment may be more readily detected.&nbsp; Cohort characterization studies should be submitted to this FOA only if the data to be collected are needed for the design of a clinical trial or trials in the near future.&nbsp; Natural history studies aimed at testing hypotheses regarding the epidemiology, genetic associations, genotype/phenotype correlations, disease mechanisms or therapeutic target identification are outside the scope of this FOA and will not be supported.&nbsp; However, studies are encouraged that address clinical trial readiness and also collect patient samples that could be valuable for future hypothesis-testing studies supported through other FOAs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p>It is not the intent of this FOA to support studies of biomarker discovery or assay characterization.&nbsp; In order to be considered for support through this FOA, the biochemical or molecular biomarker analytical assay(s) should be already characterized in terms of accuracy, precision, analytical sensitivity and specificity, effects of interfering substances, dynamic range and expected normal values.&nbsp; If the application involves the use of imaging, radiological or physiological biomarkers, methods for measuring the biomarkers should have been optimized in clinical studies (not necessarily the same rare disease patient population), and should be ready for use in a multi-site study at the time of application.&nbsp; Proposed studies may test the reproducibility of biomarker measurements at multiple clinical sites and the relationship between the biomarker measurement and patient survival, function or other disease-associated symptoms.&nbsp; Studies aimed at developing COA instruments may include cross-sectional evaluation to assess score reliability (test-retest or inter-rater) and construct validity, as well as longitudinal evaluation to assess responsiveness.&nbsp;

National responses to PWID often are weak and usually lag responses among other populations. Similarly, PWID engagement in HIV care generally lags behind other key populations and the larger population of people living with HIV. Even in some &ldquo;general population epidemic&rdquo; countries, HIV disparities among PWID can limit the overall success of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 strategy.</p>    <p>Strategies that promote seeking PWID, providing them with HIV testing, and/or engaging and retaining in care to achieve durable viral suppression need to be implemented for the 90-90-90 prevention and control strategy to be effective. More service integration is needed in affected countries, including integration of HIV prevention and treatment for PWID as well as integration of drug use and HIV services. This requires better models for program implementation and efforts to increase the implementation capacity of national HIV/AIDS programs among PWID. In recent years, donors have made funding available for medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid dependence and for syringe service programs, along with supporting efforts to better engage PWID in HIV treatment. These have created opportunities for implementation activities, although technical support capacity varies greatly by country.</p>    <p>The collective experience of countries with well-established HIV epidemics among PWID has been that significant, often dramatic decreases in new HIV cases among PWID can occur in the context of infrastructures that enable active engagement of PWID, while also linking them to HIV testing and care. This generally involves well integrated systems of substance use and public health services, as well as a variety of substance use services to enable engagement and re-engagement of PWID. Low to middle income countries often have rather limited specialty service infrastructures for PWID and linkage of PWID to health care may be limited. In addition to infrastructure characteristics, PWID in low to middle income countries often have personal and social contexts that differ from countries where PWID epidemics have successfully been addressed in the past (e.g., more dispersed PWID populations; PWID living with families of origin; larger proportions of women including those of child bearing age) and these may present unique challenges and opportunities to implementing seek, test, treat and retain (STTR) strategies. STTR implementation is likely to need specialized tailoring in settings where social norms, legal environments, and stigma-producing conditions may discourage PWID's participation in HIV care, drug treatment, or other drug user services such as syringe service programs.</p>    <p>This FOA supports development and testing of implementation approaches that provide ways to scale-up evidence based interventions in low to middle income countries where PWID form an important component of the national HIV epidemic, including countries where PWID are a relatively emergent population for HIV cases. Sustainable programs will need to align with national HIV/AIDS plans and provide models for large scale implementation such as QA/QC systems. Applicants are encouraged to work with local or regional PEPFAR and Global Fund programs, which have platforms for reaching PWID and provide access to local epidemiology and services data. PEPFAR&rsquo;s implementing partners include SAMHSA which provides specific substance use technical assistance in a number of countries. Recently implemented donor programs including syringe services and drug treatment settings that can be leveraged to provide or actively link to additional HIV and substance use services. Some countries are developing new health financing systems that also can be leveraged to expand HIV prevention and treatment for PWID. Some countries are working toward criminal justice reforms that may shape the size and scope of services available to PWID. Applicants are encouraged to take advantage of these opportunities as well as to leverage collaborations of existing NIH initiatives such as IeDEA (NIH&rsquo;s cohort of cohorts co-funded by NIDA) which provide clinical cohort platforms that can be leveraged for new research or existing NIDA-funded research studies.</p>    <p>Research that makes use of clinical trial designs well suited to local tailoring of project implementation such as adaptive or optimization designs are encouraged. Applications need not address all stages of the HIV care continuum but should address timely entry or re-entry (for those out of care) into HIV care, retention in HIV care and steps toward viral suppression.

In 2014, there was an estimated 29 million falls reported in the United States. On average these falls result in an estimated cost of $31.3 billion to Medicare. Compared to men, women are more likely to report a fall or fall injury. Nevertheless, these injuries are not a normal part of aging and can be prevented. Medications can contribute to the problem of older adult falls and injuries. Approximately 88 % of older adults take at least one prescription medication and over a third of older adults take five or more. Medications that affect the central nervous system (CNS-active), such as opioids and benzodiazepines, can cause side effects such as dizziness, sedation, confusion, blurred vision, and orthostatic hypotension. The CNS-active medications have been linked to falls, fractures, motor vehicle crashes, and memory impairment, and they account for a number of avoidable emergency department visits and hospital admissions. Additionally, long-term opioid use has been associated with serious risks, including increased risk for opioid use disorder and unintentional overdose.</p>    <p>When taken together CNS-active medications can have a synergistic effect on cognition and physical function, potentially leading to more falls, motor vehicle crashes, and/or unintentional overdose risk. Taking three or more centrally acting medications, known as CNS polypharmacy, is associated with an increased risk of adverse drug events including falls, injuries<br />and deaths. Many of these falls and injuries result in these patients presenting to the hospital emergency room for treatment. A recent study found that women patients were more likely to have CNS polypharmacy when compared to men. In those with CNS polypharmacy, opioids were the most commonly prescribed medication group (76.2%), followed by benzodiazepines (61.8%).</p>    <p>Therefore, appropriate prescribing of opioids and benzodiazepines in older adults is encouraged in order to minimize such synergistic effects on cognition and physical function. While reducing the dose of these medications has been found to reduce the risk of falls, stopping therapy completely can sometimes be challenging. Tapering is strongly recommended for medications like opioids and benzodiazepines to minimize withdrawal symptoms. Tapering may be dependent on dosage, drug pharmacokinetics, and prescriber and patient preferences. To assist in minimizing the use of opioids, benzodiazepines, and other CNS-active medications, some strategies and tools for medication tapering and/or discontinuation exist. For example, a recent study found that tapering and/or discontinuation of opioids and benzodiazepines is likely to be successful within the context of multidisciplinary care, collaboration with behavioral health, and availability of other therapies. Further, the Veterans Health Administration successfully implemented a pharmacy consult to reduce co-prescribing of opioids and benzodiazepines through the Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI). Numerous organizations and agencies have promoted strategies and guidelines to taper and/or discontinue medications. Some examples of tapering guidance include the Washington State tapering guideline, the Mayo Clinic's Continuing Medical Education (CME) on tapering long-term opioid therapy in chronic noncancer pain, the benzodiazepine and Z-drug safety guideline, and the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain and associated implementation tools. Nevertheless, there is no accepted standard of practice for tapering either benzodiazepines or opioids in the United States, and evidence on the effectiveness of different protocols is extremely limited.</p>    <p>There is a need to identify, implement, and rigorously evaluate the impact of such strategies and tools, including assessment of potential benefits, harms, and cost implications, with a specific focus on falls and overdose as pertinent health outcomes. There is also a need for evidence of how well tapering strategies for opioids and/or benzodiazepine therapies have reduced falls or other injuries among patients with CNS polypharmacy. Projects funded under this NOFO will aid our understanding of the overall effectiveness of tapering and/or discontinuation strategies to reduce falls and unintentional injury among older adults. For patients, this research will provide tools to help with the tapering and/or discontinuation process. For providers, the funded research can offer tools to improve prescribing patterns of opioids, benzodiazepines, and other CNS-active medications. Once adopted and implemented, identified strategies may assist in decreasing the rates of falls fall related injuries, and other injuries among older adults (e.g. overdose, motor vehicle injury).</p>"12438,Grant,"Analytical Validation of Candidate Biomarkers for Neurological Disease     <div class=""heading4""><strong>Purpose</strong></div>    <p>The overarching purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to fill critical scientific gaps needed to advance strong candidate biomarkers of neurological disease from discovery to clinical use.

In addition, biomarkers allow the evaluation of therapeutic intervention on disease progression or recurrence, as well as on the clinical manifestation of disease phenotype or severity. They are also being used to improve early diagnosis and therapeutic outcomes in cases where disease or disease manifestation could be significantly attenuated with treatment. Despite the active pace of discovery of novel biomarker candidates, few biomarkers progress beyond discovery to analytical validation and clinical practice, and robust, well-validated biomarkers for use in Phase II and Phase II clinical trials remain scant.

In the United States, about 3,500 infants die suddenly and unexpectedly yearly from unexplained causes such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or accidental suffocation. These Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID), a major cause of infant mortality, account for about 16% of all US infant deaths. SUID is a subtype of Sudden Death in the Young (SDY). SDY includes infants as well as children and young adults through 19 years old who die unexpectedly. Although very little is known about the incidence of SDY, it is commonly associated with unexpected death, cardiac conditions such as cardiomyopathy or arrhythmias, and possible genetic forms of epilepsy. Some studies suggest that 10-20% of SUID cases may be attributable to undiagnosed cardiac conditions. About 80% SDY cases are classified as SUID.</p>    <p>Establishing the incidence of SUID and SDY is difficult because arrhythmias, epileptic events, SIDS and infant suffocation cases are often unwitnessed events and leave no markers to be found at autopsy. Death certifiers designate varying causes-of-death given similar cases. Because of inconsistencies in reporting and classification practices, the ability to consistently and accurately monitor national trends or evaluate prevention programs for SUID/SDY is limited. The Sudden Unexpected Infant Death and Sudden Death in the Young Case Registry (SUID/SDY Case Registry) aims to uniformly documents information about the circumstances and factors surrounding these deaths, and uses a validated algorithm to categorize cases based on standardized criteria and levels of evidence available, leading to a better understanding of factors associated with SUID/SDY. Current recipients use case information for program<br />planning and evaluation, modifying public health practice and policy, and reporting Title V Performance Measures. ;Title V funds are in 59 states and jurisdictions and seek to create federal and state partnerships that support health promotion efforts that seek to reduce infant mortality specifically through safe sleep. In addition to surveillance activities, the SDY Case Registry optional expanded component is funded with support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and involves collaboration with a data coordinating center to support more detailed analysis of these cases. This collaboration is detailed in the collaborations section of this NOFO.</p>    <p>The SUID/SDY Case Registry builds upon existing child death review (CDR) programs that follow protocols developed by the National Center for Fatality Review and Prevention (NCFRP). CDR programs are active in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and the Navajo Nation totaling 1,350 individual teams. CDR teams compile information from various data sources on unexpected deaths, including birth and death certificates, death scene investigation, law enforcement, and child protective services. Thus, building on the work and data collection activities of these existing programs and teams, SUID/SDY Case Registry has access to the necessary information to characterize and determine the incidence of SUID and SDY.</p>    <p>This NOFO continues the collaboration with the NIH and combines two existing NOFOs (DP14-1403 and DP15-1506) under one funding mechanism and allows applicants to apply for a single county with a population about 1 million or in multiple non continuous forensic jurisdictions or those serving multiple counties or statewide surveillance, choosing the option where they know they can be successful.

In this regard, the human apolipoprotein E2 gene (ApoE2) has been consistently well replicated in multiple studies as a longevity-associated variant providing protection against age-related diseases. However, the extent to which we understand the influences of ApoE2 on specific health outcomes varies, and its impact on brain aging and cognitive outcomes still remains unexplored. Studies of the phenotypic and functional characterization of ApoE2 represent unique opportunities for finding new mechanistic insights, identifying potential prognostic and diagnostic markers, and developing therapeutic targets for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) and other age-related cognitive disorders. These newly identified mechanistic insights, that involve brain and/or other organs, could help in developing novel strategies to protect against age-related cognitive impairment, neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. In turn, these insights could lead to new translational research opportunities not only to prevent or delay the onset of AD, but also to protect against multiple age-related conditions (as opposed to any single disorder).</p>    <p>Although the ApoE gene has been widely studied as a risk gene for AD, the phenotypic effects of its allelic variants and functional pathways have yet to be characterized. Common isoforms of the ApoE protein include E4, E3 and E2 which are encoded by the e4, e3 and e2 alleles, respectively. In particular, the e2 allelic variant has been found to be more prevalent among centenarians and associated with decreased susceptibility to cardiovascular disease and AD. The association of the ApoE2 variant to longevity with lower prevalence of stroke, coronary heart disease and cancer has also been replicated in multiple populations. A small number of studies on the role of ApoE2 in relation to AD and other neurological disorders suggest that ApoE2 is neuroprotective and that its protective effects vary with the stage of AD. ApoE2 has also been positively associated with cognitive functions in aging. An eight-year-long follow-up study in a large cohort of elderly, dementia-free subjects demonstrated that individuals who possess at least one ApoE2 allele (e2/2 and e2/3) exhibit improved episodic memory performance. By contrast, a decline in performance was found in subjects with the e3/3 genotype, and a sharper decrease was found in those with at least one ApoE4 allele. Results from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study revealed that ApoE2 carriers have larger hippocampal volume and reduced hippocampal atrophy rate compared to non-carriers.</p>    <p>While there is an abundance of research demonstrating the neurodegenerative effect of ApoE4, far less is known about the mechanisms by which ApoE2 exhibits neuroprotection. A few studies have identified major differences in bioenergy and synaptic functions of brains expressing different ApoE isoforms, with ApoE2 contributing to neuroprotection. This protective role of ApoE2 could potentially be mediated by mechanistic pathways and genes associated with brain Igf1 signaling, cholesterol homeostasis and synaptic transmission. ApoE is a glycoprotein best known as a mediator and regulator of lipid transport and uptake, but with several additional physiological and pathological roles postulated, ApoE participates as a protein chaperone, mediator of inflammation and tumorigenesis, and a regulator of neuronal growth. Structural differences in the ApoE isoforms that differ in amino acid composition at 112 and 158 modulate domain interactions with multiple proteins and receptors as well as with protein stability and protein folding. These interactions, in turn, influence the activity of ApoE in an allele-specific manner on functional pathways that contribute to neuroprotection or neurodegeneration. In addition, ApoE isoforms show diverse cellular expression in the brain, signifying the importance of determining how ApoE expression is regulated in specific cells in the brain during development and in pathological conditions. The ApoE alleles may also contribute to epigenetic alterations of the ApoE CpG islands, possibly involving protein binding, chromatin remodeling, and specific RNA regulation in an age-dependent manner. Thus, interplay between genetic and epigenetic variations could also be another important molecular mechanism underlying ApoE's association with AD and cognitive disorders.</p>    <p>In spite of reports from model organisms and animal models demonstrating beneficial effects of ApoE2 in the aging process, the development of therapeutics around ApoE2 for AD and dementia has been very slow, with the few therapies developed for humans failing in preclinical stages with a high rate of drug attrition. Fundamental hurdles to the translation of ApoE2 into novel therapeutics appear to be due to lack of information on genotype-phenotype relationships, its pleiotropic functions, and the mechanistic pathways mediating the protective effects in terms of risk for AD and other age-related cognitive disorders. It is anticipated that further insight into the effects of APOE2 in various tissues and functional crosstalk within and across tissues with aging and AD will help to advance future translational research efforts.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives</strong></div>    <p>The primary emphasis of this FOA will be on the &ldquo;ApoE2&ndash;Aging&ndash;AD"" relationship, which will elucidate the mechanistic effects of this protective variant on aging and the potential interaction and crosstalk across tissues and brain aging and AD.</p>    <p>The FOA will focus on the following research issues:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Phenotypic characterization of the effects of ApoE2 in various tissues and their relationship to AD;</li>    <li>Molecular, cellular, and physiological pathways influenced by the gene variant and their relationship to AD;</li>    <li>Comparison of rate of aging in the brain and other organs under the influence of ApoE2 to the onset of AD and prevalence of comorbidity associated with AD and cognitive disorders in carriers of ApoE2;</li>    <li>Potential prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers or molecular signatures in any relevant tissue for the pathogenesis of AD; and</li>    <li>Development of therapeutics and interventions that target the effects of ApoE2 on aging for the purpose of prevention or amelioration of AD symptoms.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>Examples of potential studies to address the above research objectives include but are not limited to:</p>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Secondary data analyses of human phenotypic data from epidemiologic studies, clinical trials, or other clinical studies, based on existing databases or de novo data collection (from ongoing clinical research studies), to gain better understanding of the clinical relationship of ApoE2 to risk and progression of aging and AD and other neurological diseases, aiming to identify potential physiologic factors that mediate such relationships.</li>    <li>Molecular profiling (genomic, proteomic, lipidomic and metabolomic) of stored human biospecimens or specimens collected de novo (e.g., additional follow-up visits of existing cohort) to understand the relationship of the ApoE2 genotype to mRNA and protein levels, cellular functional pathways, and pharmacogenetics effects, as well as the relationship between ApoE2 and risk for aging, AD, and other neurological diseases.

As HIV-1 infection progresses, the blood count of CD4 T-cells declines from its normal of 500 &ndash; 1500. A CD4 blood count below 200 is a diagnostic indicator of AIDS. Thus, the CD4 count enables a clinical test for HIV-1 infection, the progression towards developing AIDS, or the ability of treatment regimens such as anti-retroviral therapies [ART] to prevent disease progression. However, HIV-1 infection can induce additional neurological, behavioral, and cognitive deficits, even when the detrimental effects of viral infection on the immune system [CD4 counts] are managed by ART. These HIV-induced complications might be further exacerbated when other disorders, such as substance use disorders [SUDs], co-occur with viral infection.

Central to these new programs is providing the trainees with the knowledge and skills required to participate in large-scale team-science efforts needed to solve data-intensive biomedical problems in basic research and therapy development for AD/ADRD, while nurturing the skills necessary to be an independent investigator leading team-science research.</p>    <p>The program will be open to academic institutions with expertise in one or more areas of translational research who can leverage NIA's investment in research on AD and aging to advance cross-disciplinary training in new approaches to AD/ADRD treatment and prevention, including research on health disparities in AD/ADRD. Applications appropriate to this FOA will have the active participation of training faculty with expertise in the following disciplines/research areas:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>The biology of aging and neurodegeneration</li>    <li>Various aspects of data science, including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, computational biology, bioinformatics, mathematics, engineering, and biophysics</li>    <li>Traditional and emerging drug discovery and drug development disciplines, including medicinal chemistry, high-throughput screening, quantitative pharmacology, toxicology, pharmacometrics, and clinical trial design</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>It is expected that these interdisciplinary training programs will involve multiple departments at the institution, including the biological, medical, bioinformatics, computational, engineering, and mathematical sciences. Trainees with backgrounds in clinical and behavioral research (e.g., epidemiology, psychology, geriatrics, health disparities), mathematics/computational biology/engineering, or biology/neuroscience with a strong interest in research on AD/ADRD would be considered among the eligible pool of applicants for the training program. Training programs may include partnerships among institutions and between academic institutions and industry.</p>    <p>An important component of the program will be providing trainees an opportunity to undertake a research project in one of the academic institutions affiliated with NIA's large-scale open science consortia such as AMP-AD, M2OVE-AD, or ADNI, or in the laboratories of industry partners participating in these consortia. Trainees in these programs should thus be mentored by two or more faculty mentors, who together with the trainee will develop an individualized training plan that will provide:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>A strong foundation in research design, methods, and analytic techniques appropriate for the proposed research area;</li>    <li>The enhancement of the trainees' ability to conceptualize and think through research problems with increasing independence;</li>    <li>Experience conducting research using state-of-the-art methods as well as presenting and publishing their research findings;</li>    <li>The opportunity to interact with members of the scientific community at appropriate scientific meetings and workshops; and</li>    <li>The enhancement of the trainees' understanding of the health-related sciences and the relationship of their research training to health and disease.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>The proposed institutional research training program may complement other ongoing research training and career development programs at the applicant institution, but the proposed program must be clearly distinct from related programs currently receiving Federal support.</p>    <div class=""heading4"">Program Considerations</div>    <p>The duration of training, the transition of trainees to individual support mechanisms, and their transition to the next career stage are important considerations in institutional training programs. Training PDs/PIs should limit appointments to individuals who are committed to a research career and who plan to remain in training for no less than two years, whether that support comes from a training grant or some combination of NRSA and non-NRSA support programs. Training PDs/PIs should encourage and make available appropriate skills training so that trainees are prepared to apply for subsequent independent support for their training or research program (e.g., an individual fellowship award, mentored career development award, or research project grant), as appropriate for their career stage. In addition, past studies have shown that health professional trainees who train in programs with postdoctoral researchers who have intensive research backgrounds are more likely to apply for and receive subsequent research grant support. Programs that emphasize research training for individuals with the MD or other health-professional degrees are therefore encouraged to develop ties to basic science departments and include trainees with research doctorates when this approach is consistent with the goals of the proposed training program.</p>    <p>Biomedical research and the resulting scientific knowledge are increasingly complex and multidisciplinary in nature. Training PDs/PIs are encouraged to develop institutional training programs that will expose trainees to a diversity of scientific approaches, systems for study, research approaches, and tools and technologies. Consideration of team-based research approaches may also be warranted depending upon the goals of the proposed training program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p>Within the framework of the NRSA program's longstanding commitment to excellence and the projected need for investigators in particular areas of research, attention must be given to recruiting trainees from racial or ethnic groups underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral and clinical sciences, individuals with disabilities, and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. See Section IV for more information.</p>    <p>The career outcomes of individuals supported by NRSA training programs include both research-intensive careers in academia and industry and research-related careers in various sectors such as academic institutions, government agencies, for-profit businesses, and private foundations. Training programs should make available structured, career development advising and learning opportunities (e.g., workshops, discussions, Individual Development Plans). Through such opportunities, trainees would obtain a working knowledge of various potential career directions that make strong use of the knowledge and skills gained during research training and the steps required to transition successfully to the next stage of their chosen career.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p>Institutional research training grants must be used to support a program of full-time research training. Within the full-time training period, research trainees who are also training as clinicians must devote their time to the proposed research training and must confine clinical duties to those that are an integral part of the research training experience. The program may not be used to support studies leading to the MD, DDS, or other clinical, health-professional training except when those studies are part of a formal combined research degree program, such as the MD/PhD. Similarly, trainees may not accept NRSA support for clinical training that is part of residency training leading to clinical certification in a medical or dental specialty or subspecialty. It is permissible and encouraged, however, for clinicians to engage in NRSA-supported, full-time postdoctoral research training even when that experience is creditable toward certification by a clinical specialty or subspecialty board.</p>    <p>Short-term training may be provided to expose trainees to research technologies and concepts that can be successfully acquired in a focused, intensive, two- to three-month exposure. The short-term training experience should enhance skill development in the core dimension(s) of translational research of the training program. Didactic instruction must include training in the responsible conduct of research. Short-term positions on NRSA institutional training grants may not be used for courses and study leading to the MD, DDS, DO, DVM, or other clinical, health professional degree, nor to support residency training.</p>    <p>Research elective credit may be granted for students who complete a short-term, research training experience supported by the T32. The decision to award elective credit will be at the discretion of the sponsoring institution and must be consistent with the policies of the institution (see Funding Restrictions).</p>    <p>Grantee organizations may provide training to students enrolled at other institutions through a partnership or consortium structure. Consortia should be well justified to enhance the goals and objectives of the training program. Consortium partners will be identified by the applicant organization, and each partner institution must identify faculty at their location who have agreed to serve as mentors.</p>    <p>This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) does not allow appointed Trainees to lead an independent clinical trial, but does allow them to obtain research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor. NIH strongly supports training towards a career in clinically relevant research, and so gaining experience in clinical trials under the guidance of a mentor or co-mentor is encouraged.</p>"12508,Grant,"From Association to Function in the Alzheimers Disease Post-Genomics Era     <div class=""heading4""><strong><a name=""_Toc258873267""></a>Background</strong></div>    <p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) is a progressive, degenerative disorder of the brain and is the most common form of dementia of the elderly.&nbsp;AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Prominent behavioral manifestations of AD include memory impairments and decline in other cognitive domains.&nbsp; Currently, at least five million Americans at age 65 and older suffer from AD, and it is projected that the number of new cases of AD will double by 2025. AD is clearly becoming a national health crisis affecting Americans across the country, and the total annual payments of health care for people with AD are projected to be more than $1 trillion in 2050.&nbsp;In response to this looming public health crisis, the National Alzheimer&rsquo;s Project Act (NAPA) was signed into law in 2011. The primary research goal of the NAPA is to prevent the onset of, and develop effective treatments for, AD by 2025.&nbsp;As part of the strategic planning process to implement NAPA, NIH AD Research Summits were held in 2012 and 2015 and identified research priorities and strategies needed to accelerate basic research and the development of effective therapies. A FY2017 Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease bypass budget with milestones was published in 2015 to establish research and funding priorities in response to the NAPA and the AD Research Summits (https://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/bypass-budget-fy2017). This funding opportunity announcement was developed in response to the recommendations of the AD Research Summits and milestones published in the FY2017 Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease bypass budget to support interdisciplinary research to understand the heterogeneity and multifactorial etiology of AD.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The etiology of AD is multifactorial and complex, and the vast majority of cases cannot be attributed to a single genetic factor.&nbsp;Many large-scale &ldquo;omics&rdquo; and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of late-onset Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (LOAD) have identified at least 20 loci that are associated with AD risk.&nbsp;Despite the fact that some of these genes and variants only have small effects on AD risk, bioinformatics and pathway analyses have allowed researchers to identify many functional activities, such as endocytosis, immunity, cholesterol metabolism and synaptic transmission, that are involved in the genetics of LOAD.&nbsp;However, the experimental strategy following GWAS and whole-genome sequencing projects to identify genetic variant function has not been so straightforward, one reason being that SNPs associated with these risk genes are often located in non-coding regions.&nbsp;In addition, current pathway and network analyses from numerous &ldquo;omics&rdquo; and GWAS studies have not been able to identify AD-specific pathways and only allow one to identify gene networks that are currently curated in KEGG and Gene Ontology databases.&nbsp;Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a series of robust and transparent functional and computational pipelines to truly determine whether the genetic risk variants and pathways identified can be used for hypothesis generation and in-depth mechanistic studies.&nbsp;</p>    <p>For the past few years, the NIA has invested significantly in various large-scale studies in the areas of systems biology, epidemiology, biomarker discovery, imaging and genomic sequencing projects on LOAD to identify potential targets for the early diagnostics and treatment of AD. To address causal genotype-phenotype relationships in AD, two RFAs from NIA have also been issued to use human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to address the potential pathological consequences of SNPs in AD risk genes.&nbsp;As a result, the generation of AD-specific iPS cell lines could potentially allow one to create comprehensive cellular and molecular models for all AD risk genes and their variants.&nbsp;However, using global or &ldquo;omics&rdquo; expression studies to address the functional and pathophysiological contributions of late onset and sporadic AD-sequence variations in iPSC lines is somewhat limited, since it is often difficult to obtain appropriate culture conditions to recapitulate the molecular signatures of aging and LOAD.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives</strong></div>    <p>Currently, the AD research community is facing many different challenges between identifying critical AD risk gene variants and elucidating the potential biological and pathological functions of these variants in the initiation and propagation of AD. Protein activity and function are the end-game mediators of the effects of AD risk gene variants.&nbsp;For example, gene variants may affect protein-DNA or &ndash;RNA interactions, protein translation, or protein complex formation that may be missed by &ldquo;omics&rdquo; expression approaches.&nbsp;As a consequence, it is critical to identify and develop more effective ways to rapidly screen variants for impact on potential biological functions prior to any in-depth mechanistic studies.&nbsp;In addition, this initiative also encourages investigators to create a more integrated and effective platform to identify protein-protein interactions, protein complexes and their regulation caused by AD genetic variants.&nbsp;To build on the large amount of genetics and &ldquo;omics&rdquo; datasets generated with support from NIA supported GWAS, Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) and other projects, this initiative strongly encourages collaborative and multi-institutional research applications designed to quickly reduce the complexity of GWAS, DNA sequencing and &ldquo;omics&rdquo; datasets, either computationally or experimentally; and to provide a robust pipeline to validate the function at the protein level of candidate variants using in vitro and in vivo model systems.</p>    <p>Areas of research interest include, but are not limited to:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Implementation of Proteome-Wide Analysis of disease-associated SNPs (PWAS) on non-protein coding regions to identify allele-specific transcription factor binding and alteration of promoter or enhancer activity in AD. The advantage of using unbiased PWAS for AD research is that it will allow one to link genomic studies to protein function without prior information.</li>    <li>Comprehensive and deep proteomics analyses to understand the impact of GWAS genetic variants and identify key molecular signatures and networks in modulating the early pathogenesis of AD.&nbsp;Any protein expression profiling analysis solely to generate a large dataset without any functional validation will not be considered responsive.</li>    <li>Testing of the function of coding genetic variants and to determine the roles of genetic variants or post-translational modifications, cell signaling and protein homeostasis in sporadic AD.&nbsp;Functional analysis can range from biochemical assays to imaging of cells or tissues in various in vitro and in vivo models of sporadic AD.</li>    <li>Implementation of local and web-based in silico model systems to predict the three-dimensional structure and function of mutant vs. wild-type AD risk proteins, particularly if the mutations are located within the protein coding sequence.&nbsp;However, it is expected that any variant function identified by in silico model analysis will need to be confirmed by a complementary in vitro biochemical, cell or animal-based assay.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><strong>Criteria for non-responsive applications:</strong></p>    <p>Applications that propose to only use protein expression levels to evaluate the function of genetic variants will not be considered responsive.</p>    <p>Applications that propose purely to address the correlation between the protein expression of genetic variants and AD related pathologies, such as accumulation of amyloid and PHF tau, will not be considered responsive.</p>    <p>Applications aimed to solely identify additional genetic variants or potentially associated genes through additional GWAS studies without any functional studies will not be considered responsive.</p>"12512,Grant,"Development of Medications to Prevent and Treat Opioid Use Disorders and Overdose         <p><strong>Background</strong></p>    <p>There is a devastating opioid use and overdose crisis in the United States. It has been reported that approximately 25.5 million adults suffer pain and opioids that are often prescribed for their treatment can lead to opioid misuse and dependence. It has also been reported that more than 2 million Americans have OUDs and many started their addiction with prescribed opioids. One of the most devastating consequences of opioid misuse is opioid overdose, which can produce respiratory depression and death. Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the US, with an estimation of 60,000 deaths in 2016; 20,101 overdose deaths related to prescription pain relievers, and 12,990 overdose deaths related to heroin.</p>    <p>Although there are safe and effective pharmacotherapies for opioid use disorders and to prevent/reverse overdose, their use has some limitation or they are largely underutilized. Methadone and buprenorphine are approved by the FDA to treat OUDs but long term efficacy and treatment adherence are sub-optimal. Naltrexone is approved by the FDA to prevent opioid use relapse in people with no physical dependence to opioids but initiation and adherence to treatment are low. Naloxone is approved to reverse opioid overdose but it has a short action, may precipitate opioid withdrawal, and put the person at risk of overdose.</p>    <p>Currently, there are no medications approved by the FDA for the treatment of opioid withdrawal (including medications to treat the opioid withdrawal of neonates born to mothers with OUDs). Lofexidine is being investigated for the treatment of opioid withdrawal and is pending review by the FDA to determine its approval. Other medications such as gabapentin, pregabalin, buprenorphine, cannabinoids, ketamine, and ultra-low doses of oral naltrexone, as well as rapid opioid withdrawal under anesthesia have been evaluated but the results are inconclusive.</p>    <p>Advances in the understanding of OUDs, overdose, and pain may provide new pharmacological opportunities to improve the treatment of these disorders and contribute to reduce the current opioid use crisis. Some of these advances include the new findings of receptors, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and brain circuits associated with OUDs, a greater understanding of the endogenous opioid system, and the risk and protective factors for the onset and progression of these disorders. New targets and medications, new formulations and delivery systems of medications may be ready to be evaluated. Better understanding of pain mechanisms has revolutionized our understanding of addiction and pain and new, non-addictive pain medicines are urgently needed to prevent the initiation or progression of OUDs and prevent overdoses. Furthermore, advances in the development of biologics can offer an opportunity to investigate vaccines and monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of OUD and overdose.</p>    <p>Buprenorphine treatment, given its partial agonist effects, may offer a unique pharmacological opportunity to reduce the lethality of opioid overdose. Relapse prevention with the opioid antagonist naltrexone may also reduce the risk of overdose. The FDA will soon be reviewing the NDA of weekly and monthly injections of buprenorphine which appear to improve treatment adherence and hopefully</p>    <p>improving outcomes including preventing opioid overdoses.</p>    <p>There is an urgent need to accelerate the development and obtain FDA approval of medication to prevent and treat OUDs and overdose. Multiple therapeutic approaches may be poised for the next step in the FDA approval process and concerted efforts are needed to advance these potential pharmacotherapies to approval. New scientific advances in this area offer unprecedented opportunities to develop these types of medications.

As the population ages, this number is projected to increase two- to three-fold by 2050 without a cure or prevention for the disease. AD is one of the most persistent and devastating dementias of old age because it eventually leads to a complete loss of memory and independent function. Currently, there are only a few interventions that have been approved for the treatment of AD; those approved have demonstrated only modest effects in modifying the clinical symptoms for relatively short periods, and none have shown a clear effect on disease progression. In response to this looming public health crisis in the United States, the National Alzheimer&rsquo;s Project Act (NAPA) was signed into law in 2011. The primary research goal of NAPA is to find effective interventions to treat and prevent AD and related dementias by 2025. As part of the strategic planning process for the implementation of the NAPA, two Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease Research Summits entitled &ldquo;Path to Treatment and Prevention&rdquo; were held in 2012 and 2015. The overarching goal of the Summits was to bring together leading experts on Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease to identify research priorities and strategies needed to accelerate the development of effective therapies across the disease continuum. The Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit in 2015 specifically recommended to: &ldquo;Invest in understanding the integrative physiology of sleep and elucidating the short- and long-term consequences of disrupted and optimized sleep on brain aging and AD.&rdquo;</p>    <p>An estimated 70 million people in the United States suffer from a sleep disorder. About 30 million Americans experience chronic insomnia, and approximately 18 million suffer from sleep apnea; however, it is estimated that fewer than 50% are diagnosed. Difficulties with sleep are common complaints among the elderly as more than half of older Americans report chronic sleep problems.</p>    <p>Older adults with AD often exhibit sleep disturbances and circadian clock disruptions. Although this has been interpreted as a consequence of AD, there is evidence that sleep disturbances may contribute to the risk of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. For example, it has been demonstrated that preclinical signs of AD are often associated with poor sleep quality. Moreover, A&beta; accumulation in the brain predicts and exacerbates sleep disruption in humans and in animal models, and experimental manipulations to increase sleep result in decreases in A&beta; deposition. Such findings provide support for interventions that improve sleep in older adults to reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Effective interventions exist to improve sleep, and these could be tested in AD prevention.</p>    <p>While it appears that there is a bidirectional relationship between chronic sleep and circadian disruption and AD pathogenesis, and previous studies have established that humans with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and mice with A&beta; pathology develop sleep and circadian dysfunction, very little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved. Studies suggest synaptic activity-driven A&beta; release is lower during sleep, supported by the observation that slow wave sleep disruption increases cerebrospinal fluid A&beta; levels. There are data demonstrating that the clearance of A&beta; from the brain is facilitated through the glymphatic pathway during sleep. It has been proposed that metabolic dyshomeostasis, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, is induced by disrupted sleep along with A&beta; and tau to promote feed-forward neuronal injury that hastens AD onset and progression. There are suggestions that A&beta; pathology impairs the function of the core circadian clock in microglia in vivo, and that disruption of the circadian clock gene function in glial cells exacerbates neuroinflammation and sensitizes the brain to downstream AD-related injury.</p>    <p><strong>Research Objectives</strong></p>    <p>Although there are ongoing research efforts to determine the association between sleep disturbances and circadian clock disruptions with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, only a few address the molecular and cellular mechanisms of this association.</p>    <p>Therefore, this FOA is aimed at molecular, cellular, genetic, epigenetic, and systems biology approaches to advance basic and clinical research on the causes and consequences of sleep deficiency and circadian clock dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease, and the roles of sleep and the circadian clock as modifiers of the progression of neurodegeneration. A multiple-principal investigator (PI) format will be required with one or more PD/PIs leading mechanistic studies related to neurodegeneration, and one or more PIs leading research in sleep and/or circadian biology.</p>    <p>This FOA solicits molecular and cellular research on animal models across a range of topics intersecting the fields of aging, neurodegeneration, and sleep and/or circadian biology.

Frequently, these compounds are phenolic acids, which may be derived from a wide range of precursors. These small, gut-derived metabolites may ultimately be the missing link that explains the widely acknowledged health benefits of diets high in fruits and vegetables.</p>    <p>A handful of investigators are conducting research in this area, and they have provided a proof of concept to support the hypothesized interaction between the microbiome, dietary phytochemicals, and improved health outcomes. A concerted effort is now needed to systematically identify the variety of microbial metabolites produced, the commensal bacteria responsible for their production, and their potentially beneficial biological activities.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Importantly, many of the studies to date suggest that these metabolites may be effective anxiolytic, antidepressant, and/or antiinflammatory agents, but the mechanisms by which they impart these biological activities are poorly understood. Furthermore, these metabolites may impact many biological pathways simultaneously rather than acting through a single mechanism. This pattern of activity has been called a biological signature. This FOA is intended to encourage applications that will provide much needed data to fill current gaps in our understanding regarding the abundance and variety of these gut-derived metabolites and how they individually and/or collectively might have biological signatures associated with improved measures of health and resilience.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Various omics technologies, particularly targeted and untargeted metabolomics, are well suited to detect and validate correlations between the chemical profile of gut-derived metabolites and their biological profile of activities (i.e., biological signature) in phenotypic models of interest to NCCIH. These biological signatures could in turn lead to the development of mechanistic hypotheses regarding new therapeutic tools.</p>    <p>This FOA will allow human mechanistic studies (which can be a type of clinical trial), but they must be designed to measure mechanistic endpoints (e.g., establishing a biological signature) rather than assess efficacy in modulating any clinical outcome.

This initiative provides candidates with protected time and mentored guidance to augment or redirect their research career trajectories within the NIDCD research mission. It focuses on established investigators holding the academic rank of Associate Professor or Professor, or the equivalent in non-academic research settings, who have records of scientific accomplishment and independent research support (past and/or present).&nbsp; The purpose of this FOA is to provide such investigators with support for short-term, intensive periods of mentored research experience over a period of six- to twenty-four months to acquire new research capabilities in the study of hearing, balance, smell, taste, voice, speech, or language sciences.&nbsp; Such experiences, typically undertaken during an academic sabbatical year, will afford candidate investigators protected time to: 1) enrich and expand their expertise and research programs through retooling in new techniques, emerging technologies, and/or scientific areas; 2) redirect their research programs in new trajectories within the NIDCD scientific mission; and/or 3) catalyze research collaborations in new research directions.&nbsp; It is expected that this initiative will lead to new and augmented research programs competitive for NIH funding.&nbsp; In addition to serving as a short-term career development vehicle for investigators within the NIDCD Extramural research community, this program is also intended for investigators working outside of the hearing, balance, smell, taste, voice, speech, and language sciences who wish to add research direction within the NIDCD scientific mission to their overall research programs.</p>    <p>The research career enhancement experience shall take place in a host laboratory, whether in the applicant institution (i.e., in which the candidate holds his/her primary appointment) or in another institution with the appropriate resources to provide the proposed research career development experience.&nbsp; In both cases, the tutelage of a well-qualified host/mentor (or team of mentors/hosts) is required.&nbsp; In most cases, the applicant and proposed mentor(s) and host laboratory will not have had previous research collaborations.</p>    <p>The research career development experience proposed must have the potential to substantially augment the research capabilities of the candidate at the applicant institution, and provide new research opportunities and benefits that would not be achievable through a collaborative research grant with the mentor(s).&nbsp; The research career enhancement experience should be tailored to the individual needs and level of experience of the candidate, and will generally incorporate two components: 1) didactic (e.g., directed study/tutorials, semester-long courses, short courses, seminar series, journal clubs) and/or laboratory-based training/instruction in the new discipline, techniques or technologies; and, 2) a small-scale research project at the host site.&nbsp; The research enhancement experience may comprise translational or clinical/patient-oriented research (including epidemiologic, outcomes and health services research)</p>    <p><a name=""_Hlk490643399""></a><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is designed specifically for applicants proposing to serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial a feasibility study, or a separate ancillary study to an existing trial, as part of their research and career development.

While insurance status or co-morbidity might be thought of as the most reliable surrogate for prediction of surgical outcome differences, the delay of surgery, referral patterns, facility or clinician volume and resources and suboptimal clinician-patient communication, and unconscious biases are but a few additional mechanisms that can lead to disparities in access to safe and quality surgical care and optimal outcomes.</p>    <p>Research suggests that as much as 11-30% of the global burden of disease requires surgical care or anesthesia management or both &ndash; a figure that underscores the fundamental role of surgery as part of the essential health care.&nbsp; A recent report released by The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery reveals substantial growing trend in the global burden of disease that is amenable to surgical intervention.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.thelancet.com/commissions/global-surgery"">http://www.thelancet.com/commissions/global-surgery</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p>According to the CDC, approximately 51 million inpatient surgical cases are performed in the U.S. each year. (2010). Outpatient surgical cases outnumber inpatient cases at 53 million, and procedures in both settings account for an appreciable share of the healthcare costs and resources.&nbsp; Health services research often fails to reflect the integral role of optimal access to safe surgical care and medical management as part of its goals.&nbsp; The structure and processes of care delivery dictate similar to non-surgical care, surgical outcomes.&nbsp; When suboptimal structure and processes are associated with patient characteristics, disparities in outcomes follow.</p>    <p>Some mechanisms or factors contributing to surgical disparities include patient characteristics, clinical care and quality, variations in surgical practice and referral patterns, clinician factors, healthcare system-level factors and post-operative care and medical rehabilitation.</p>    <p>Numerous patient characteristics have been identified as contributors to surgical disparities, including demographic (e.g. race), physiologic (e.g. immune status), health literacy and culture including beliefs, values and preferences.&nbsp; Compared to Whites, Blacks receive fewer reconstructions after mastectomy, arthritis-related knee and hip surgery and pulmonary resection for early stage lung cancers. Other factors such as socioeconomic status (SES) also impact these issues. Patients with low SES are less likely to receive appropriate surgical services, including bariatric surgery, hepatocellular carcinoma resection and transplants regardless of age. Low SES patients who receive needed surgical care often have worse outcomes and higher mortality than otherwise similar higher-income patients. Conversely, patients with higher income and higher education are more likely to receive appropriate surgical services and have better outcomes.</p>    <p>In meta-analysis of studies analyzing odds of death after trauma, African American patients had higher odds of death compared to White patients. In other studies analyzing surgical outcomes, certain racial and ethnic population groups were at signi?cantly higher odds of experiencing surgical complications than others.&nbsp; African Americans had higher operative surgical morbidity and post-surgical mortality than Whites. Disparities in postoperative mortality based on SES have been consistently demonstrated after major surgery.&nbsp; The elderly (and especially those from socially disadvantaged groups &ndash; racial and ethnic, low SES) are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for surgically and potentially curable diseases such as abdominal aortic repair (AAA) or early-stage oncologic diseases.&nbsp; Likewise female gender and especially those from racial and ethnic minority groups, is associated with decreased probability of undergoing certain potentially life-saving surgical procedures, including revascularization for severe coronary artery disease surgery after acute myocardial infarction and certain cancers; e.g. curative intent versus palliative debulking in cervical cancer.&nbsp; Racial and ethnic minorities with chronic kidney disease on dialysis, are less likely to receive counseling about renal transplantation, be waitlisted for transplant, and receive transplant.&nbsp; Even though the some of the research shows that racial and ethnic minority patients are more likely than White patients to decline surgical procedures, overall differences in refusal rates tend to be generally low and patient refusals does not fully explain the persistent disparities in outcomes.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Disparities in clinical care and quality are often dictated by procedural mechanisms such as adoption of evidence-based clinical guidelines, quality improvement strategies that also focus on addressing disparities such as patient-centeredness, shared decision-making, satisfaction and perceived quality of care.&nbsp; Clinical decision-making due to bias and stereotyping can also lead to disparate outcomes among patients.&nbsp; Simulated studies demonstrated the impact of implicit bias on the clinician&rsquo;s decision-making, and require real-world clinical assessment.&nbsp; Surgical care and training has evolved as a result of carefully structured scientific investigations of evidence-based studies that have shown that many of the traditional approaches to surgical care, such as preoperative bowel clearance, the use of nasogastric tubes and drains placed in cavities, or use of slowly advanced diets are unnecessary or even harmful.&nbsp;Newer evidence-based practices have demonstrated that surgical recovery can be accelerated, recuperation decreased and co-morbidities minimized for all patient groups. An integrated approach focuses on enhancing recovery and reducing morbidity by implementing evidence in the fields of anesthesia, analgesia, reduction of surgical stress, fluid management, minimal invasive surgery, nutrition, and ambulation.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The potential mechanisms by which system-level factors influence outcomes in surgical disparities have been documented in the literature.&nbsp; Structural variation (in resources and practice pattern) is thought to be responsible for a large proportion of between-hospital quality differences in surgical outcomes, such that racial/ethnic minority patients living in low SES zip codes may be more likely to present to hospitals with low structural quality and suffer worse outcomes. Process entails the acts of care delivery; these may vary significantly both between and within hospitals. Process variations, including choice of procedure, adherence to guidelines, and specialty referral, have all been linked to racial/ethnic minority patient status.&nbsp;</p>    <p>While differences in the surgical outcomes associated with race and ethnicity have been well documented, less is known about other demographic associations, including immigration status, English language, fluency, health literacy, numeracy, rurality, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Research is needed to understand these demographic associations with poor outcomes, to address and promote use of clinician and/or health professional- and patient-centered technologies, redesigned surgical care pathways and systems demonstrations, including enhanced tracking and incentive strategies to yield high-value, equitable surgical care.&nbsp; In addition, there are research gaps in implementation of multi-level intervention strategies (patient and clinician or patient and clinician and healthcare system).</p>    <div class=""heading4"">&nbsp;</div>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives and Scope</strong></div>    <p>The goal of this FOA is to invite exploratory, novel studies that break new ground or extend previous discoveries toward new directions in understanding and addressing disparities in surgical care and outcomes, including the factors that influence the disparities.

An early area of emphasis for addiction health services researchers was to move beyond training of individual clinicians or service providers as a default implementation strategy, and develop interventions that would achieve broader, sustainable implementation at the organizational level. Some research has begun to look at intra-organizational implementation strategies to further accelerate the implementation of evidence-based practices (or de-implementation of unsupported or harmful practices). However, to date, a major remaining challenge is how to facilitate &ndash; in a systematic, scalable, sustainable way &ndash; the delivery of evidence-based prevention and treatment services at a system level.</p>    <p>This FOA seeks research projects that will move beyond a focus on how individual clinics or organizations implement a given change, and beyond implementation of interventions that target only a single evidence-based intervention (EBI). The purpose of this FOA is to identify efficacious and effective strategies or techniques for facilitating systems-level change within or across networks of organizations to promote broad use of evidence-based practices for the prevention and/or treatment of substance use disorders or HIV. This FOA seeks applications that can address implementation on a larger, system-level scale that is more analogous to the way policy changes lead to system-level changes in prevention and treatment service delivery. Achieving system-level improvements requires implementation strategies that are sufficiently flexible to address the variation in settings and context across a given system, but that are also generalizable across settings. The multi-site studies supported by this FOA should contribute both practical and conceptual advances.&nbsp; In practical terms, these studies should provide strategies that can be used to effectively deploy guidelines, practices, and policies across entire systems of care.&nbsp; In conceptual terms, these studies should also leverage the multi-site platform to test implementation science hypotheses, explore novel methodological approaches, or test new measures or models that can inform future implementation research in this or other health domains.</p>    <p>Applicants may address a range of addiction health services including, but not limited to, tobacco-cessation services, substance use prevention services, medication assisted treatments, HIV/AIDS services, polysubstance use treatment, treatment of co-occurring disorders, etc.&nbsp; Likewise, a wide variety of settings could be targeted, including traditional behavioral health service settings, primary care settings, health care settings where substance use or use disorders are relevant (e.g., cancer treatment), and other settings where individuals are routinely referred for substance use prevention or treatment services (e.g., child welfare, juvenile justice, criminal justice).

A &ldquo;system of care&rdquo; may be viewed as occurring within the health care or behavioral health system or may include organizations that do not provide behavioral health services, but that routinely refer clients for substance use prevention or treatment. Examples of a system of care include a community coalition involving multiple agencies in a community to address substance use prevention, relationships between child welfare and community-based service providers to address substance-use related needs for parents and children, collaborative care models for complex patients that involve multiple organizations (e.g., smoking cessation treatment for cancer patients).&nbsp;</p>    <p>It is not required that participating organizations have pre-existing working relationships at the time of application; developing these relationships may be a targeted outcome. However, it is expected that a multi-site system-level approach will necessitate a design that extends beyond any single organizational entity, and that the study design will attend to the implications of meaningful differences in context, funding, internal policies, geography, and local regulations, etc. that influence implementation outcomes.</p>    <p>This FOA requires applications to propose multi-site studies involving two or more performance sites that are part of the targeted system or system of care (e.g., addiction clinics, FQHCs, juvenile justice systems). This FOA is intended to encourage conceptual and practical insights from efforts to examine implementation at a large scale. Beyond the multi-site requirement, this FOA does not require a predetermined minimum number of sites. However, projects should aim to test implementation approaches that can reasonably be expected to generalize beyond the sites involved, and applicants should describe the potential for system-level scale-up beyond the project. Proposed studies are expected to attend to the multi-level contextual factors that would be informative in understanding the generalizability of the proposed study. Applicants are expected to select the most rigorous study design appropriate for their research question and proposed settings. While randomized controlled trials are welcomed and encouraged, there are instances in which RCTs are neither optimal nor feasible for implementation research studies.&nbsp; Selection of an alternative study design should be well-justified on the basis of appropriateness, relevance, rigor, and reproducibility.</p>    <p>This FOA is intended to support rigorous studies that will provide insights into large-scale implementation via multi-site studies. Specific examples of the types of research supported under this mechanism include, but are not limited to:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Rigorous designs evaluating innovative approaches to implementing large-scale change, including technology&ndash;based approaches</li>    <li>RCTs and/or other rigorous designs evaluating sustainable and scalable large-scale approaches to implementing health information technologies and clinical decision support (CDS) tools to enhance coordination and continuity of substance use care, including linkages across data systems that allow assessment of meaningful relevant outcomes (e.g., engagement in care, cause of death, etc.) &nbsp;</li>    <li>RCTs and/or other rigorous designs comparing multiple change strategies or attempting to determine &ldquo;active ingredients&rdquo; &nbsp;or ""minimal intervention needed to produce change (MINC)"" in existing change interventions, strategies, frameworks, or models</li>    <li>Longitudinal designs addressing the sustainability of the targeted improvements in evidence-based practice, de-implementation of existing non-evidenced based programs or practices, or phased implementation of multiple EBPs</li>    <li>Tests of new or evidence-based operating systems or implementation models for large-scale delivery of evidence-based drug abuse treatment or prevention interventions in novel systems and settings (e.g., primary care, juvenile justice, child welfare, criminal justice)</li>    <li>Studies that take advantage of policy changes and/or new &nbsp;practice guidelines for addressing behavioral health and provide opportunities for innovative approaches to large-scale implementation of drug abuse prevention and treatment services (e.g., the Affordable Care Act Community Benefit requirement, Bright Futures guidelines for well-child visits, coordinated care through Accountable Care Organizations)</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>All applications that propose analyses of costs or financing should be consistent with current NIH priorities for health economics research.

Addiction-related research has traditionally been supported separately by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), and, in specific areas, by National Cancer Institute (NCI). In 2012, the CRAN initiative was conceived as a trans-NIH partnership involving NIDA, NIAAA, and NCI to facilitate a functional integration of support for the research related to substance use, abuse, and addiction.&nbsp; The main goal for CRAN is to create strong collaborative framework that enables NIDA, NIAAA, and NCI to pool resources and expertise in order to create synergies in addiction science, address new research opportunities, and meet public health needs.&nbsp; CRAN currently supports FOAs that promote collaborative research on crosscutting topics relevant to alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) use.&nbsp; Applications that address multiple substances of abuse are encouraged through this FOA. More details on the CRAN and CRAN priorities can be found at:&nbsp;<a href=""http://addictionresearch.nih.gov/cran-strategic-plan-2016-2021"">http://addictionresearch.nih.gov/cran-strategic-plan-2016-2021</a></p>"12610,Grant,"Accelerate Innovative Drug and Device Discovery     <p class=""Heading4""><strong>Purpose</strong></p>    <p>The intent of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to encourage applications from academic, biotechnology, biomedical device industry, or pharmaceutical industry investigators interested in participating with the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), or the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) in a National Cooperative Drug/Device Discovery/Development Group (NCDDG) program. The objectives of this program are: to advance the discovery, preclinical development, early stage human studies, and/or proof of concept (PoC) testing of new, rationally based candidate agents or devices to treat mental disorders or substance use disorders (SUDs) or alcohol addiction; and to develop novel ligands and novel brain circuit-modulatory technologies as tools to advance biological research on the function of genes, cells, biochemical pathways, distributed neural circuits, and neural oscillatory patterns implicated in the etiology and pathophysiology of mental disorders, SUDs or alcohol addiction, and as potential new therapeutics. Partnerships between academia and industry are strongly encouraged.</p>    <p>Each NCDDG program should consist of a multi-disciplinary team of scientists with appropriate expertise to further the development and evaluation of novel compounds &nbsp;and/or of proposed biomedical devices. Scientists from both academia and pharmaceutical industry are encouraged to participate within an NCDDG; scientists from foreign institutions and NIH Intramural laboratories may participate in some aspects. It is anticipated that the interaction of academic and non-profit research institutions with industry and NIH via the NCDDG model will: 1) accelerate the discovery and development of new therapeutics for mental disorders, SUDs or alcohol addiction; 2) increase the availability of pharmacologic research tools (including imaging agents) for basic and clinical research; 3) facilitate the development and validation of (neuro)physiological and pharmacodynamic (PD) measures to evaluate novel therapeutics for mental disorders, SUDs or alcohol addiction; 4) increase the availability of new compounds and agents suitable for testing in humans; 5) facilitate the development and validation of new clinical measures or biomarkers suitable for use in human PoC trials of novel therapeutics for mental disorders, SUDs or alcohol addiction; and 6) explore and validate neurostimulation technologies and protocols for mental disorders.</p>    <p>The goal of the NCDDG program is not to duplicate or compete with the private sector but to complement and accelerate the development of research tools for new molecular and circuit targets implicated in mental disorders, SUDs or alcohol addiction, and effective compounds, agents and devices for the prevention and treatment of psychiatric and addictive disorders, as well as core features of these illnesses, especially in areas of unmet medical need.</p>    <p class=""Heading4""><strong>Background and Research Objectives</strong></p>    <p>Significant advances in neuroscience, genetics and related omics, behavioral neuroscience, together with technological developments (structural biology, in silico and high throughput screening,&nbsp;<em>in vivo</em>&nbsp;imaging methods), have provided a rich knowledge base for understanding pathophysiology, identifying new molecular targets for drug discovery, new circuit/oscillatory targets for device development, and developing rational pharmacotherapies and neuromodulation interventions for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, SUDs and alcohol addiction. With the wealth of potential new drug/device targets, the opportunity exists to accelerate the process of target validation and medication discovery to make great strides toward novel and effective treatments for mental disorders, SUDs or alcohol addiction.</p>    <p>A U01 application can include no more than a single Research Project. Applications proposing two or more Research Projects along with Scientific and/or Administrative Core components should respond to the companion FOA utilizing the U19 mechanism (see&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-18-231.html"">PAR-18-231</a>)</p>    <p class=""Heading4""><strong>NIMH's objectives and interests for the NCDDG program</strong></p>    <p>NIMH&rsquo;s objective for the NCDDG program is to support innovative, high impact research focused on the discovery of pharmacological agents selective for novel molecular targets and new neuromodulation devices targeting novel neural circuit and neural oscillatory targets with potential to prevent or reverse pathophysiological processes underlying mood and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, fragile x, autism, and other mental illnesses. Public-Private partnerships are particularly encouraged.</p>    <p>NIMH-relevant NCDDG research projects should focus on novel interventions, using either pharmacological agents or neuromodulation devices that interrogate a molecular, circuit or clinical target that is linked to a biological mechanism or pathophysiology of the proposed mental disorder. The first generation of this announcement focused on applications mostly aimed at pharmacological treatment development for mental disorders. However, NIMH recognizes that established and emerging non-invasive neurostimulation protocols and technologies are capable of directly engaging brain circuitries, exerting trans-synaptic action, and altering neural oscillatory expression. Neurostimulation methods demonstrate both therapeutic potential and promise to facilitate investigation and manipulation of brain networks implicated in disease states.&nbsp; Invasive (deep brain stimulation (DBS)) and non-invasive brain stimulation methods extend from generalized seizure protocols obtained by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), to paradigms including other electrical stimulation methods (e.g., transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), magnetic methods (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetic seizure therapy (MST)), and acoustic stimulation (e.g., focused ultrasound (FUS)). Precise understanding is needed to illuminate how different stimulation parameters modify neuronal activity or their underlying molecular basis.</p>    <p>The NIMH strongly encourages an experimental medicine approach to therapeutic development. This FOA will support up through first in human (FIH) to Phase Ia or Ib trials. For these trials, studies are expected to assess the agent/device for: 1) safety and tolerability, 2) target engagement, and 3) pharmacodynamic effects on relevant circuits or systems. Data resulting from Phase I trials in healthy controls and in the target patient population are expected to determine optimal clinical dosing and to establish feasibility for further testing in PoC and efficacy trials. Agents/devices should be sufficiently potent and selective for critical evaluation of target engagement and brain exposure. The agent/indication (if successful) should have a major, not merely incremental, impact on unmet medical need in psychiatric disorders. In support of this effort, NIMH recognizes the need for the timely development of new PET tracers for targets that are of interest for assessing target engagement/dose selection for clinical trials of novel therapeutics and for studies of the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.&nbsp; NIMH also recognizes the need for the timely development of strategies to precisely characterize delivered dosage of neuromodulation technologies (e.g., electric field modeling) and to accurately measure the impact of the delivered dosage on neural functioning (e.g. simultaneous TMS-EEG, TMS-fMRI or other technologies to demonstrate engagement of the targeted distributed network or neural oscillatory target).</p>    <p>Consistent with NIMH&rsquo;s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative, research projects directed towards ameliorating pathophysiology that is potentially more proximal to specific functional deficits (domains) than DSM diagnostic entities are encouraged. Additional information about the RDoC approach can be found at the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/rdoc/index.shtml"">RDoC website</a>. The testing of functional domains not included specifically in RDoC may also be considered, if well justified.</p>    <p>NIMH encourages applications ranging from ligand discovery and testing in preclinical assays through human Phase I studies of novel agents. Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Ligand discovery for therapeutics development or as clinical research tools (e.g., imaging probes) for novel molecular targets implicated in mental illnesses;&nbsp;</li>    <li>Target network discovery for therapeutics development or as clinical research tools (e.g., perturbation/imaging paradigms) for novel device targets implicated in mental illnesses;&nbsp;</li>    <li>Development and application of novel assays for evaluating brain pharmacodynamic (PD)/pharmacokinetic (PK) relationships in preclinical and early phase human studies;</li>    <li>Initial Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology, safety pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics to support an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin human clinical testing;</li>    <li>Initial Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) safety, delivered dosage modeling (device analog to pharmacology), and physiological response to delivered dosage (device analog to pharmacokinetics) to support an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application to the FDA to begin human clinical testing;</li>    <li>Phase I studies (FIH pharmacology experiments) that include PD/PK biomarkers to assess target engagement, functional pharmacological activity or physiological effect, safety, and tolerability of new drugs and devices;</li>    <li>Novel tool and biomarker development to enable studies to assess target engagement, brain PD and PK for innovative drug targets; for example, PET tracers for evaluating receptor occupancy and interrogating dose response relationships;</li>    <li>Novel tool and biomarker development to address target engagement, brain PD and PK for innovative device targets; for example, perturbation-imaging paradigms to evaluate neural circuit target engagement and interrogate dose response relationships;</li>    <li>Development of neurostimulation technologies and protocols, particularly non-invasive paradigms) to validate efficacy and specificity in targeted brain circuitry leading to measurable behavioral outcomes;</li>    <li>Elucidation of mechanisms by which neurostimulation acts such as molecular cascades involved in cellular and synaptic plasticity, excitatory/inhibitory balance, and epigenetic process;</li>    <li>Phase Ib studies in the proposed disease population to confirm target engagement, establish optimal dosing, PK/PD, CNS exposure, functional pharmacological or neurophysiological activity, and tolerability of the novel agent/device.</li>    <li>The inclusion of PD measures to assess functional pharmacological activity of the agent is encouraged in dose finding studies.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p class=""Heading4"">NIDA's objectives and interests for the NCDDG program</p>    <p>NIDA's interests for the NCDDG lie in the discovery of ligands, biomarkers, and devices that constitute important tools that enhance translational therapeutic development for SUDs. Over the past decade or so, there have been major advances in our understanding of the protein targets, neural circuitry, and behavioral phenomena associated with addiction, and in the effects of drugs of abuse on CNS processes associated with addictive behavior, such as synaptic plasticity. Given that research has elucidated some of the basic mechanisms through which addictive drugs act in the CNS, novel opportunities now exist for the discovery and development of therapies to treat SUDs.</p>    <p>Ligand discovery: From NIDA's perspective, the development of molecules with a particular profile of action as prototypes for medications to treat addiction or as tools to advance research in the treatment development domain. A number of cellular and animal models are currently available for ligand discovery efforts relevant to SUDs treatment research. It is therefore expected that groups will include a program to evaluate the efficacy of novel ligands in appropriate models. Components of NIDA-relevant NCDDG research projects could include, but are not limited to: (1) behavioral assessments of novel ligands in tests of intoxication, reinforcement, withdrawal and/or relapse; (2) tests of the ability of novel ligands that modulate cellular processes of plasticity in reward-relevant regions of the brain; (3) assessment of ligand efficacy on G-protein coupled receptors and ligand gated ion channel activation; and (4) receptor activation effects on down-stream intracellular systems or in modulating the release of addiction-relevant neurotransmitters. Projects that propose integrating two or more of these approaches also are encouraged.</p>    <p>Biomarkers/Devices: The identification of new biomarkers that could serve as diagnostic or prognostic measures for SUD disease progression are strongly encouraged - especially those that identify minimally invasive (peripheral) biomarkers. The discovery of associated measurement devices is also encouraged. The NCDDG discovery program is not intended to study validated biomarkers or to validate putative biomarkers that are actively studied. Both clinical and preclinical studies may be supported by this FOA.</p>    <p>Devices: This program, from NIDA&rsquo;s perspective, would also support the discovery and development devices related to diagnosing or treating SUDs. Support for pre-clinical to inform a final device design that would have to go through most, if not all, of the preclinical testing on the path to clinical trials and market approval would be encouraged.&nbsp;</p>    <p class=""Heading4"">NIAAA's objectives and interests for the NCDDG program</p>    <p>NIAAA's interests for the NCDDG program are in the discovery of novel ligands that may lead to the development of medications for the treatment of alcohol dependence and addiction, and ligands to be used as tools to research biological processes contributing to compulsive drinking. The focus of proposed research projects should follow that described above by NIMH, but should be relevant to the mission of NIAAA. Applicants are strongly encouraged to discuss applications involving toxicity, safety and pharmacokinetic as well as PoC studies of novel compounds with NIAAA staff listed in Section VII. Agency Contact(s). Scientific/Research Contacts.</p>    <p>Pharmaceutical strategies currently of interest for treating alcohol use disorders include agents that: a) reduce craving or the urge to drink, b) reduce the signs and symptoms of acute and protracted withdrawal including sleep disturbances and anxiety, and c) treat co-morbid psychiatric illnesses or reduce psychological distress which contributes to elevated alcohol consumption. Alcohol's multiple biological effects, and the many physical and behavioral alterations that occur following chronic alcohol use and abuse, offer opportunities for developing additional pharmacotherapies.</p>    <p>NCDDG is an opportunity to identify and develop compounds towards both existing and new molecular targets having the potential to treat alcohol use disorders, or to facilitate and enhance basic and clinical research on identifying the neurobiological and behavioral processes that contribute to the transition from voluntary to compulsive drinking. Aspects of alcohol consumption and alcohol-seeking are modulated through the actions of neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, ion channels, neuromodulators, hormones, and intracellular signaling networks. Thus, there are a number of potential target sites for which new pharmaceutical agents may be developed, such as effectors of neurotransmitter systems, neuroimmune pathways, and signal transduction pathways.</p>    <p>Cellular models may be used as initial screening tools to evaluate the molecular properties of candidate compounds. However, it is further expected that the more promising compounds will be tested and evaluated in established animal models of behavioral aspects of alcoholism, such as drinking, dependence, craving and reinstatement models. As no single compound is expected to address all of the behavioral aspects and consequences of alcoholism, projects that propose integrating two or more behavioral testing paradigms are sought.</p>    <p>The identification and pursuit of agents towards novel targets previously un-recognized or understudied for the treatment of alcohol abuse disorders are especially encouraged. In particular, NIAAA encourages applications focusing on agents that alleviate craving and dysphoria during protracted abstinence, and agents effective in patients who have co-morbid psychiatric illnesses (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder). Applications that essentially propose to further extend the testing of established or well-studied compounds and strategies are not appropriate for this FOA.</p>    <p class=""Heading4""><strong>Summary</strong></p>    <p>In summary, the NCDDG Program will support broad, innovative, multidisciplinary approaches to the discovery of new, rationally based treatments and research tools for mental disorders, SUDs or alcohol addiction. Since the creative talents in the required scientific disciplines are rarely available in a single institution, a multi-institutional, group approach involving academic, nonprofit, commercial, and/or industrial institutions is envisioned. Academic, pharmaceutical, and biomedical technology scientists are strongly encouraged to form partnerships that take full advantage of their combined intellectual and material resources for drug discovery, lead optimization, model development, and clinical testing. Further, the interaction of academic and non-profit research institutions with pharmaceutical and biomedical device industry and NIH is expected to facilitate subsequent development and marketing of new pharmacologic and device treatments, although these latter activities are not within the scope of this FOA. Molecular targets for drug/device discovery, and the sources and types of chemical/circuit entities to be investigated, will be selected by the applying group. Both novel mechanism of action and disease-oriented approaches are of interest.</p>    <p class=""Heading4""><strong>Research Scope</strong></p>    <p>The objective of this FOA is to establish NCDDG Groups to conduct innovative, high impact research focused on the discovery and testing of chemical entities for novel molecular targets, as well as novel devices for novel circuit/neural dynamic targets implicated in the pathophysiology of mental disorders, or SUDs or alcohol addiction. The NCDDG serves as a vehicle for pharmaceutical, biomedical device and academic scientists to pool intellectual and material resources for the translation of basic science findings into the conceptualization, discovery, and evaluation of new chemical entities and devices. Groups are encouraged to select molecular targets for drug discovery and circuit targets for device discovery based on recent findings in basic and clinical neuroscience, genetics, and proteomics relevant to the understanding of mental disorders, SUDs or alcohol addiction.</p>    <p>The identification of lead compounds/devices and refining them for target validation and medication development are important goals of this initiative.</p>    <p>It is anticipated that the interaction of academic and non-profit research institutions with NIH and pharmaceutical industry will facilitate timely evaluation and development of preclinical and clinical research tools, models, and novel therapeutics.</p>    <p>Applicants seeking additional sources of support for preclinical development activities such as toxicology and safety pharmacology assessment, bulk synthesis, GMP synthesis, and formulation development should consider the NIH Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network program (<a href=""http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/bpdrugs/index.htm"">http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/bpdrugs/index.htm</a>) and/or the NIH Bridging Interventional Development Gaps (BrIDGs) Program (<a href=""http://www.ncats.nih.gov/research/reengineering/bridgs/bridgs.html"">http://www.ncats.nih.gov/research/reengineering/bridgs/bridgs.html</a>).</p>    <p>Prior to submission of an application, applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the relevant Scientific/Research Contact listed in Section VII of this FOA to determine if the proposed Research Project would be considered a priority for NIMH, NIDA or NIAAA.</p>    <p>Applications with data collection plans that involve multiple respondent groups (e.g., clients/patients, therapists/providers, supervisors, administrators) should consider provisions for human subject protections and consenting procedures for all participant groups, accordingly.

The goal is to fund medication studies that will have high impact and yield the necessary results to advance medications closer to FDA approval. It is expected that these U01s will be short-term (funded for up to 3 years) and large (up to $5 million per year) grants, with close monitoring and significant scientific involvement of NIDA staff. These U01s will enable studies that would not be feasible using the traditional R01 activity code.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The development of safe and effective medications for the treatment of Substance-Use Disorders (SUDs) including substance use (i.e., abuse and dependence) and induced disorders (e.g., intoxication, delirium, psychotic disorder, and anxiety disorder) is a public health priority. According to the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) of 2009, an estimated 22.5 million Americans aged 12 or older met DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence or abuse (i.e., marijuana, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants and the nonmedical use of prescription-type pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives). Furthermore, an estimated 70 million Americans aged 12 or older were current users of tobacco products.</p>    <p>Although most individuals with SUDs do not seek treatment, there is a number that seek and receive treatment. According to the 2009 NSDUH, approximately 4.3 million people aged 12 or older received treatment for a problem related to the use of alcohol or illicit drugs. Of these, 1.6 million received treatment for the use of alcohol and illicit drugs, 0.8 million received treatment for the use of illicit drugs but not alcohol. Results from the same study revealed that, 1.2 million persons reported receiving treatment for marijuana use, 787,000 persons for cocaine, 739,000 for pain relievers, 517,000 for stimulants, 507,000 for heroin, 443,000 for hallucinogens, and 421,000 for tranquilizers. Moreover, according to the CDC, approximately 40% of current smokers make a quit attempt. Therefore, there is a potential to improve the lives of a large number of individuals by enhancing the armamentarium of efficacious pharmacotherapies for SUDs.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Currently, there are medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of nicotine and opiate dependence. However, none of these medications provides the optimal therapy. Moreover, there are no FDA approved medications for cocaine, methamphetamine, or cannabis use disorders. Thus, the development of safe and effective medications to treat these disorders is an urgent public health need. Improving the outcome of treatments for SUDs with medications can have vast public health implications. It has been suggested that, for example, smoking cessation programs yield more immediate reductions in the rates of tobacco addiction. In addition, tobacco use cessation offers many important health benefits, including a reduction in premature mortality due to cardiovascular events to near nonsmoker levels within two years or less of smoking cessation. Similarly, it is likely that effective pharmacotherapies for illicit drug use will produce more not only immediate reductions in the rates of drug use as well as on its immediate medical and psychosocial consequences.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Scientific advances are offering extraordinary opportunities for the development of medications to treat SUDs. These include the discovery of genes and proteins, receptors, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and brain circuits associated with drug abuse, as well as risk and protective factors for the onset and progression of these disorders, and the development of new small and large molecules such as vaccines. Multiple therapeutic approaches, ranging from small molecules to biologics (e.g., vaccines) are ready for the next step in the FDA approval process, and concerted efforts are needed to advance these potential pharmacotherapies to approval.</p>    <div class=""heading4"">Research Objectives</div>    <p>Applications submitted in response to this FOA may focus on studying 1) new chemical entities (NCEs), 2) already-marketed pharmacotherapies, 3) biologics (immunotherapies such as vaccines and antibodies, enzymes, gene therapies, etc.), 4) combinations of medications, and/or 5) new delivery devices/technologies.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The medications investigated for SUDs may target one or more of the neuropathological mechanisms, the various clinical stages, and/or the medical/psychiatric complications of one or multiple SUDs.</p>    <p>This FOA encourages, but is not limited to, studies of medications for SUDs in the following areas:</p>    <p>Chemistry and Pharmaceutics: lead compound optimization, creation/expansion of small molecular libraries, high-throughput screening, medicinal chemistry, formulation or drug-delivery technology, prodrug, proteinaceous (e.g., vaccines and antibodies), and/or bioassay development of potential medications for SUDs.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Preclinical Development:&nbsp; drug interaction studies between medications and drugs of abuse and evaluation of safety and/or efficacy in established animal models, as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of potential pharmacotherapies for SUDs.</p>    <p>Clinical Development: Phase I - Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, dose-ranging, and/or initial efficacy in human subjects.

All Common Fund initiatives invite investigators to develop bold, innovative, and often risky approaches to address problems that may seem intractable or to seize new opportunities that offer the potential for transformation of research processes.</p>    <p>The simplicity and broad applicability of targeted and programmable genome editing approaches, including but not limited to those based on CRISPR-Cas9, raise the possibility of a fundamentally new way to treat a variety of rare genetic diseases, as well as numerous therapeutic strategies for common diseases.&nbsp; However, many challenges need to be overcome before such techniques could be widely used in the clinic. Participants in a 2017 NIH workshop identified several research areas in need of investment, including optimized genome editors, specifically targeted delivery systems, and more predictive animal models and studies. Although research in each of these fields has been very active, efforts have focused on the needs of individual studies and not on overall procedures for improving and testing the safety and efficacy of genome editing approaches.</p>    <p>To maximize the potential of genome editing technology to treat as many diseases as possible, the SGCE program has been developed to accelerate the translation of genome editing technology into clinical applications. The key components of the SCGE program include: (1) better animal models for assessing genome editing in vivo (SCGE Animal Models,&nbsp; RFA-RM-18-012 and RFA-RM-18-013); (2) tools and assays to detect adverse consequences of genome editing in human cells (SCGE Biological Systems, RFA-RM-18-015); (3) new technologies to deliver genome editing machinery into disease-relevant cells and tissues in vivo (SCGE Delivery Technologies, RFA-RM-18-016); (4) novel genome editing and engineering systems (SCGE Editing Systems, RFA-RM-18-017); and (5) the SCGE Dissemination and Coordinating Center (SCGE DCC, RFA-RM-18-018). The SCGE DCC will make the results, tools and technologies developed under this program widely available to facilitate adoption for translation into clinical applications.</p>    <p>The deliverables of the SCGE program will be a collection of tools, methods, data, and best practices that will accelerate development and testing of new treatments for many diseases (i.e., the SCGE Toolkit for Therapeutic Genome Editing or SCGE Toolkit). The SCGE program will involve collaborative research by a partnership of genome editing experts, delivery systems experts, animal model creators and assay developers to produce validated techniques and knowledge through exchange of expertise, information and research tools. Awardees from all five SCGE program components will form a Consortium, governed by a steering committee of investigators and NIH staff that will develop consensus policies and procedures for Consortium-wide activities such as data and resource sharing. Contingent on availability of funds, the NIH plans a future funding opportunity for Large Animal Testing Centers that will use either pigs or non-human primates, including wild-type animals as well as reporter animals developed by RFA-RM-18-013, to assess efficacy and safety of&nbsp;<em>in vivo</em>&nbsp;genome editing and delivery technologies. It is expected that all awardees will collaborate to accelerate the translation of genome editing technologies into treatments for human disease.</p>    <p><strong>Research Objectives</strong></p>    <p>The objective of this Funding Opportunity Announcement is to support research aiming to develop innovative genome editing systems with improved specificity, efficiency, or functionality over currently available systems. Expanding the repertoire of genome editing tools would accelerate the development of novel genome editing therapeutics to treat a broad array of rare and common diseases.</p>    <p><strong>Research Scope</strong></p>    <p>This program will support the development of novel and optimized alternative genome editing platforms to existing in vivo genome editing complexes. CRISPR-Cas is the newest and most widely adopted tool in the&nbsp;<a name=""_Hlk501111269""></a>genome editing&nbsp;repertoire, which already consists of diverse methodologies including mega nucleases, transposons, recombinases, protein nucleic acids, transcriptional activator-like effector nuclease (TALENs) and Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs). Advances in the TALEN and ZFN platforms have resulted in improved on-target modification efficiency and decreased off-target activity. Creative engineering of CRISPR-associated nucleases including fusion with other editing enzymes, transcription factors or chromatin modifiers has already led to programmable editing of genomic DNA or RNA without double-stranded DNA cleavage as well as directed modulation of endogenous gene expression. Nevertheless, there continues to be a need to invest in fundamental advances in genome editing technology with novel biological capabilities, and improved efficiency and precision, to maximize their clinical applicability for the treatment of a variety of diseases.</p>    <p>Expanding the repertoire of genome editors will greatly increase the power of genome editing for therapeutic development. Improvements in programmable nucleases are being rapidly generated, but significant drawbacks remain to be addressed. For example, off-target cleavage, which may result in undesired genomic rearrangements and other genotoxic effects, has been reported. Another significant issue with the current targeted nuclease approach is that low efficiency in homology-directed repair (HDR) is an impediment to genome editing when DNA insertions or replacements are required. Nuclease cleavage results in double-strand breaks (DSBs), which activate the cellular error-prone nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. Repair through this pathway leads to unpredictable sequence rearrangements after the lesions have been repaired, with potential detrimental effects. Relevant to in vivo therapy, pre-existing immunogenicity to the Cas9 proteins from&nbsp;<em>S. aureus&nbsp;</em>has been reported. Finally, the large size of nuclease genes can reduce transduction efficiency and be difficult to package in some viral vectors, such as adeno associated virus.</p>    <p>Genome editing technology supported by the SCGE Consortium is defined broadly, extending beyond nuclease-dependent activities for manipulating DNA and thus may also include, but not be limited to, nuclease-independent targeted editing, epigenetic modifiers, transcriptional repression and activation approaches, and RNA editors. Furthermore, the scope includes more than a single editor type (e.g., CRISPR-Cas). It is anticipated that applicants will utilize mathematical models and high throughput screening techniques, as appropriate, to identify, design, and optimize functional genome editors in an iterative manner. Design and optimization strategies to enhance genome editing capabilities in human cells can include but is not limited to:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Rational screening, directed evolution, and selection methodologies to guide the identification of complexes with novel enzymatic activities and substrate specificities.</li>    <li>Epigenome reprogramming technologies to alter the epigenetic composition of the genome at any given genomic location.</li>    <li>Strategies for manipulation of normally inaccessible genomes or genomic regions that are relevant to the treatment of certain diseases.</li>    <li>Approaches to increase the frequency of HDR within target regions, while reducing non-specific events.</li>    <li>In silico computational design, including software tools, to improve or alter the activity of existing genome editing platforms. Modeling and simulation results should complement experimental studies that quantify the genome editing system efficacy and characterize both on-target and off-target system activities.</li>    <li>Modifications of existing nucleases may be proposed, but should represent a significant enhancement compared to present nucleases, such as improved delivery or packaging in viral or non-viral vectors, short-term or regulatable expression or activity, higher fidelity with reduced off-target activity, and decreased immunogenicity.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>Funds from the NIH will be made available through the U01 cooperative agreement award mechanism.&nbsp; Awards will be up to 5 years in duration and will include milestones to evaluate progress.&nbsp; During the initial two years of funding, it is expected that investigators will complete the necessary proof of concept studies&nbsp;<a name=""_Hlk499904413""></a>demonstrating the capacity of the new or optimized genome editor(s) to perform the proposed genome modifications with improved efficacy and/or novel functionality using in vitro molecular or cell model systems chosen by the awardee.&nbsp;As part of the NIH SCGE Consortium, investigators will have access to Consortium-generated testing platforms and delivery systems, and are expected to collaborate with other SCGE Consortium members to optimize packaging strategies and initiate studies evaluating the enhancements in activity and/or safety of optimized or novel editors in cell or tissue ex vivo modelling systems and in vivo efficacy in animals.</p>    <p>Specific requirements for the applicants to this FOA:</p>    <p>An integrative research plan based on collaborations of synthetic biologists with computational scientists, cell biologists, engineers, and/or physician scientists is strongly recommended.

Furthermore, about 11% of married women had impaired fecundity, i.e., the biological capacity to reproduce in 2010 compared to 8.5% of married women in 1982.&nbsp; This upward trend likely is indicative of the delay in childbearing where significant age-related increases in infertility and subfecundity have been reported.</p>    <p>It is estimated that 12 percent of American women aged 15-44 have received infertility services at some point during their lifetime, with costs of several billion dollars annually.&nbsp; Of couples seeking treatment, it is likely that up to one half will be unsuccessful in achieving a pregnancy.&nbsp; While the infertility can be treated successfully in 80 percent of infertile women, male infertility can be treated only 10-20 percent of the time.&nbsp; This latter figure is even more concerning because at least 30-40 percent of infertility in couples is attributable to male factor infertility for which the pathophysiology is either not or poorly understood.&nbsp; Even though assisted reproductive technologies such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection can, in many cases, circumvent male infertility, the process is expensive, both from a monetary and a psychological standpoint for the couple.&nbsp; Furthermore, these technologies may bypass genetic or epigenetic causes of infertility that may also be linked to other health problems that will negatively impact the life of the unborn child and possibly later generations.</p>    <p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a disorder characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, is a major cause of female infertility.&nbsp; It is the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive-aged women, affecting between five and 10 percent of women aged 15-44 or more than four million women in the U.S.&nbsp; The infertility is due to the associated oligo-anovulation.&nbsp; Identified more than 60 years ago, the etiology of PCOS still remains poorly understood.&nbsp; Often accompanied by obesity and insulin resistance, the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus among PCOS patients is five- to 10-fold higher than in the non-PCOS population.&nbsp; Considering the high prevalence of diabetes in PCOS women, a recent study estimated that the total annualized cost of evaluating and providing care to PCOS women is $4.6 billion dollars.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Premature loss of gametes may occur spontaneously or be iatrogenic (i.e., due to treatments for diseases such as cancer).&nbsp; Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), defined as loss of ovarian function before age 40, affects approximately 1 in 100 women.&nbsp; The underlying etiology is unknown in the majority of cases.&nbsp; Interestingly, 16 percent of women carrying the Fragile X pre-mutation present with POI.&nbsp; A better understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying pre-mutation-based ovarian insufficiency may provide critical insights into the basic biological processes regulating ovarian follicular growth, differentiation, and atresia.</p>    <p>Currently, there are more than 9 million cancer survivors in the U.S., of whom approximately 5% are under the age of 35.&nbsp; Chemotherapy or local radiation treatments in these patients may deplete the gamete stem cell pool and cause permanent infertility.&nbsp; The ability to cryopreserve a testicular or ovarian biopsy prior to treatment may provide the opportunity later to generate normal offspring without contaminating malignant cells and epigenetic and/or genetic errors.&nbsp; Providing options for preserving fertility in men, women and children is not only an important reproductive health issue, but a quality of life issue as well.</p>    <p><strong>Gynecological Health:&nbsp;</strong>A number of benign gynecologic conditions are associated with substantial morbidity beyond infertility which further impact women&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; For the purpose of this FOA, these conditions are fibroids, endometriosis, and adenomyosis.&nbsp; Uterine leiomyoma (fibroids) are benign, monoclonal tumors of the uterine smooth muscle which occur in 20-30% percent of all reproductive-aged women, with nearly 70 percent of white women and over 80 percent of black women having developed at least one fibroid by age 50.&nbsp; Extremely heterogeneous in their number, size, and location, a clear racial disparity exist with fibroids presenting earlier and with greater severity in African American women. The presence of symptomatic fibroids is the most common medical indication for an unwanted hysterectomy that prematurely ends a female's reproductive options outside of uterine surrogacy.&nbsp;</p>    <p>An estrogen-dependent inflammatory disease, endometriosis affects approximately 10-15% of all reproductive-aged women and is found in 50-60% of women with chronic pelvic pain and infertility.&nbsp; Adenomyosis is a related disorder defined by the presence of ectopic endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium, leading to adjacent smooth muscle hyperplasia and hypertrophy. While endometriosis and adenomyosis share common features and may coexist, the current thinking is that they should be considered distinct entities due to differences in pathogenesis, risk factors and clinical presentation. While the prevalence of adenomyosis is unknown, adenomyosis has been identified in 25% of women undergoing hysterectomies for chronic pelvic pain.</p>    <p>These three gynecologic conditions are associated with an array of symptoms which substantially impact women&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; Depending on the disorder and its severity, location, and other factors, symptoms may include abnormal uterine bleeding, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, noncyclic pelvic pain, pressure symptoms, infertility and pregnancy loss.&nbsp; Additional studies are critically needed to further elucidate the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and optimal management of these disorders beyond an understanding of the mechanisms by which they impact fertility.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Reproductive Health in the Adolescent</strong>:&nbsp; Attention is now turning to the adolescent with the hopes that earlier diagnosis and treatment of these devastating reproductive disorders will improve long-term health including the preservation of fertility in adulthood.&nbsp; Research efforts are needed to better refine diagnostic criteria for children and adolescents and to define hormonal changes during normal progression of sexual maturation so that effective interventional strategies can be employed.&nbsp; In this regard, initial menstrual cycles are often irregular and anovulatory, making it difficult to diagnose conditions such as PCOS.&nbsp; Dysmenorrhea is often interpreted as normal for adolescents despite clear demonstration that endometriosis and, more rarely, adenomyosis may present in this age group. The development of new biomarkers, including glycoproteins, cytokines, and noncoding RNAs, as well as novel diagnostic imaging approaches should prove particularly valuable for these patients.</p>    <p><strong>Genetics and Epigenetics in Reproductive Health: &nbsp;</strong>Data now firmly support the contribution of genetics in both male and female infertility and to the development of benign gynecological disorders.&nbsp; It has been estimated that a large number of genes (1 in 25 of all mammalian genes) are specifically expressed in the male germline.&nbsp; Furthermore, animal studies indicate that mutations in over 100 separate genes result in male infertility.&nbsp; More limited studies in humans show that a number of inherited diseases associated with abnormal sperm morphology and function are likely polygenic.&nbsp; This genomic complexity contributes to the more than 40 percent of male infertile cases being classified as idiopathic.&nbsp; It is estimated that 15-20 percent of human pregnancies are chromosomally abnormal as a result of division errors during oocyte meiosis or early embryonic cleavage.&nbsp; Such errors not only are the leading cause of birth defects, but may be the single most important factor contributing to human infertility.&nbsp; For endometriosis, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated genetic variants involved in steroid hormone metabolism, inflammation, angiogenesis, WNT/&beta;-catenin signaling, and estrogen-induced cell growth, migration, adhesion, and invasion.&nbsp; Genetic mutations have been identified for fibroids, including complex chromosomal rearrangements, mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12), and fumarate hydratase (FH) inactivation.</p>    <p>In addition to the DNA sequence, an array of so-called epigenetic mechanisms may be important for the development of infertility or gynecologic disorders.&nbsp; These mechanisms include DNA methylation, post-translational histone modifications, RNA modifications (epitranscriptomics), and the action of non-coding RNAs (microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs).&nbsp; Unlike alterations to the DNA that are &lsquo;fixed&rsquo;, epigenetic changes are bidirectional, e.g., a histone may alternate between being acetylated or not depending on the transcriptional state of its associated gene.&nbsp; These epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for how the genome interacts with the environment, and changes in the epigenome are sporadic and differ from cell-to-cell.&nbsp; This heterogeneity makes analyses difficult, although techniques now exist that permit the epigenome to be interrogated at the single cell level or at the epigenome-wide level (e.g., eFORGE).</p>    <p>Epigenetics is controlled by families of enzymatic proteins called 'writers',' readers', and 'erasers'; writers add a particular mark to DNA, RNA or protein, readers translate the signal carried by the mark into a particular phenotype, and erasers remove the mark.&nbsp; As more of these enzymes have been identified, great interest has arisen in controlling gene expression via small molecule inhibitors of various epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., lysine methyltransferases, histone deacetylases). Although specificity remains an issue, some of these inhibitors already are in clinical trials for various cancers and may be found to be relevant to the reproductive field.</p>    <p>It is also becoming increasing apparent that interactions between genetic and epigenetic mechanisms and the environment are involved in the development and progression of complex diseases, including those affecting reproductive health (e.g., PCOS, endometriosis).&nbsp; Preliminary studies suggest a correlation between certain foods and the development of endometriosis, with a decreased risk in women with diets high in fruits and vegetables, fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids, and dairy products rich in calcium and vitamin D.&nbsp; Conversely, exposure to environmental toxins, particularly dioxin-like compounds, are also suspected to play a role in the development of endometriosis.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Contrary to previous thinking, the sperm contributes more than DNA to the oocyte as the epigenome has been shown to play a critical role in the developing embryo.&nbsp; Alterations in the establishment and/or maintenance of the various epigenetic marks have been shown to affect the fertility status of males.&nbsp; Of particular importance is the demonstration that environmental factors such as toxicants and diet promote multi- and transgenerational inheritance of adult-onset disease through epigenetic alterations in both males and females.</p>    <p><strong>Reproductive Status and Overall Health:&nbsp;</strong>The importance of preconception care has its basis in the Barker Hypothesis that states that adult diseases have their origins prior to birth.&nbsp; Most experimentation has examined the relationship between adverse birth outcomes (e.g., low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia, pre-term birth, birth defects) and adult disease incidence as a result of perturbing the maternal-fetal environment.&nbsp; However, it is now clear from animal models that these adverse outcomes can occur during the embryonic period and even prior to implantation or conception itself and can even be due to the paternal contribution.&nbsp; Thus, increased efforts are needed to define important developmental periods in which perturbations to normal physiological systems can result in poor pregnancy outcomes and to determine if these periods coincide with periods for epigenetic modification of the genome.</p>    <p>Data suggest that infertility and gynecological disorders are not necessarily a unique disease of the reproductive axis, but is often physiologically or genetically linked with other diseases and conditions.&nbsp; Although it is well-established that many chronic diseases and conditions can impair fertility, less is known about the extent to which reproductive status can act as a marker for overall health.&nbsp; Both male and female reproductive function have been associated with the presence of cancer, as well as conditions of the cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune systems. Validation of the premise that fertility status can be a window into overall health would provide a valuable opportunity to affect future health during fertility evaluation, allowing early intervention in serious, chronic diseases.&nbsp;Similarly, gynecologic disorders may be markers of an increased risk for other medical disorders, such as the reported link between endometriosis and ovarian cancer or coronary artery disease.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The Fertility and Infertility (FI) and the Gynecology Health and Disease (GHD) Branches recognize that interaction between basic and clinical research paradigms will be necessary to address these problems and that these requirements may be too complex to be solved by individual investigators working alone.&nbsp; Therefore, it is the intention, contingent upon the availability of funds, to continue and maintain organized, multi-component reproduction and infertility research programs of high quality that focus on topics of high priority to the mission of the FI and GHD Branches, and that address important reproductive health concerns of the American public.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Scope</strong></div>    <p>The NCTRI is composed of research-based centers designed to support interactive groups of research projects and supporting core service facilities.&nbsp; The research activities included in these centers must comprise, by definition, a multidisciplinary approach to biomedical problems addressing the specific research topic areas discussed in this FOA.&nbsp; These centers may have more than one focus or emphasis, but all of the research projects involved must address one or more of the specific research areas of research supported by the FI or GHD Branches.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Only those centers which address fibroids, endometriosis, or adenomyosis outside of their impact on fertility will be given consideration as a potential gynecologic center.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Other gynecologic/fertility disorders such as PCOS will be deemed responsive as an infertility center.

This award is intended to provide support for highly promising early stage investigators who may lack the preliminary data required for a traditional R01 and allow them to pursue their most innovative, creative, and potentially most impactful ideas at an earlier stage in their career.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Scope and Goals</strong></div>    <p>To support its mission, NIMH has formulated a&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/index.shtml"">Strategic Plan</a>&nbsp;with the following four overarching objectives:</p>    <p>1.&nbsp; Define the mechanisms of complex behaviors:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/strategic-objective-1.shtml"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/strategic-objective-1.shtml</a></p>    <p>2.&nbsp; Chart mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/strategic-objective-2.shtml"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/strategic-objective-2.shtml</a></p>    <p>3.&nbsp; Strive for prevention and cures:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/strategic-objective-3.shtml"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/strategic-objective-3.shtml</a></p>    <p>4.&nbsp; Strengthen the public health impact of NIMH-supported research:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/strategic-objective-4.shtml"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/strategic-objective-4.shtml</a></p>    <p>These four Strategic Objectives can be viewed as a cumulative progression that begins with promoting discovery in the brain and behavioral sciences in order to better understand the workings of the brain that can be translated to the study of mental disorders. In effect, our efforts to understand how changes in the brain can lead to mental illness will inform (and be informed by) fundamental research to understand the trajectories of mental illnesses across the lifespan and across diverse populations. By learning more about the trajectories by which mental illnesses develop, we hope to stimulate innovative psychosocial and biomedical approaches that can preempt or change these trajectories before mental illness occurs.

CHAVDs will support coordinated, multidisciplinary teams of researchers focused on multi-pronged approaches to accelerate HIV vaccine development by iteratively, as well as in parallel, addressing key immunogen design roadblocks to the discovery and development of a safe and effective antibody-mediated preventive HIV vaccine.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p>There are approximately 38 million people worldwide infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). While promising prevention measures have been developed over the past decade, such as male circumcision and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), the transmission of HIV-1 remains at an unacceptably high rate. In 2016, approximately 1.8 million people became newly infected with HIV and projections indicate the number of new infections will remain high unless more effective preventive measures are instituted. The demonstrated effect of treatment as prevention offers some hope that mass treatment programs such as UNAIDS' 90-90-90 program will markedly reduce the global morbidity and mortality due to HIV/AIDS. Still, the human and economic tolls of HIV/AIDS demand that these largely therapeutic activities are complemented by accelerated efforts to develop a preventive HIV vaccine.</p>    <p>Researchers have been working to develop a HIV vaccine since the identification of HIV as the etiologic agent of AIDS. Considerable progress has been made in understanding early immune responses to HIV infection and the antigenic constituents of the virus. However, only three vaccine concepts have been tested in clinical efficacy trials; two of these failed to show any efficacy while the other (the products studied in RV144, the Thai Trial) was only minimally efficacious. An efficacy trial designed to follow up the findings in RV144 is underway in Southern Africa (HVTN 702) and an efficacy trial (HVTN 705) of another candidate HIV vaccine (Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson's Ad26 Mosaic prime/gp140 protein boost) is scheduled to start in the near future. Results from these trials will not be available until 2021 and 2022, respectively, and while the hope is that one or both trials will demonstrate sufficient efficacy on which to build, it is imperative that efforts to discover and test new vaccine concepts continue in the interim.</p>    <p>Thus, even with the progress to date, a safe and effective vaccine that provides a high degree of protection from HIV infection is not yet in sight. HIV vaccine development is one of the most difficult scientific endeavors of our time and considerable challenges remain. HIV presents formidable scientific obstacles, including an unusually large genetic diversity, an ability to escape immune surveillance, and the ability to integrate into host cell genomes creating a long-lived viral reservoir. In addition, HIV vaccine development is a long and costly process, and there are numerous disincentives for the private sector to bring effort and expertise to this urgent public health problem.</p>    <p>In June of 2003, twenty-four leaders of research in immunology, HIV/AIDS science, and public health published a call for the creation of a Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise (also known as the ""Enterprise""), a consortium to accelerate HIV vaccine development through enhanced global coordination, information sharing and collaboration (Klausner RK, Fauci AS, et al. Science 300:2036, 2003). These leaders concluded that an organized, strategic, collaborative, and well-funded effort was needed to tackle the formidable scientific and operational obstacles to HIV vaccine development. In 2005, in response to this call, NIAID funded a large research consortium, the Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology (CHAVI) focused on the study of key scientific obstacles to HIV vaccine discovery, especially our lack of understanding of the host immune response during acute HIV infection.&nbsp; The progress made in understanding early events in HIV infection through this research program demonstrated the productivity of large, collaborative and multidisciplinary teams in addressing complex research questions. The findings of CHAVI and others in: characterizing the transmitted/founder virus, explaining the lack of HIV neutralization by early anti-envelope antibody responses after infection, and elucidating the reasons for impaired B cell development early in HIV infection and the rapidity with which HIV-1 infection suppresses host immune responses, suggested innovative approaches to explore in HIV vaccine design.&nbsp; Also, the results from the RV144 vaccine trial in Thailand (2003-6), which showed modest protection from infection, presented a significant new opportunity for discovery in HIV vaccine design; and CHAVI investigators played a key operational role in the immune correlates analysis performed to understand and build upon the modest efficacy observed.</p>    <p>Thus, with the recommendation of the CHAVI external Scientific Advisory Board and the AIDS Vaccine Research Subcommittee (AVRS) of the NIAID AIDS Research Advisory Committee (ARAC), in 2012 NIAID funded two large research consortia (the Centers for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery; CHAVI-ID) to accelerate HIV vaccine development. These Consortia support: (1) research into the immune responses that prevent or contain the virus, (2) discovery of new targets for antibody neutralization, and (3) the generation of immunogen constructs that will induce broad protection. The findings of the CHAVI-IDs and other HIV vaccine investigators on the evolution of anti-HIV envelope neutralizing antibody responses through extensive somatic hypermutation in concert with the evolution of the HIV-1 envelope protein give new hope for a path to the induction of such antibody responses by vaccination. Furthermore, it is hoped that the large neutralizing monoclonal antibody (VRC01) passive transfer study currently being conducted (HVTN 703/HPTN 081 and HVTN 704/HPTN 085, collectively called the AMP study) will provide clear-cut proof-of-concept that such antibodies can protect against human infection with HIV-1.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Objective and Scope CHAVD</strong></div>    <p>The objective of this FOA is to exploit recent progress in vaccine science by establishing new, large research consortia, the Consortia for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development (CHAVD), to undertake the next steps in protective antibody-inducing immunogen design research.

Over the 7-year period of award, these new research consortia should apply state-of-the-art technologies and immunologic tools to focus on iterative, rational vaccine design.&nbsp;The CHAVD research should elucidate how to elicit antibody response(s) capable of preventing acquisition of HIV infection.

Milestones</strong></div>    <p>Milestone-driven research is used to ensure research is focused on a well-defined goal and achieving that goal with greatest efficiency.&nbsp; As translational research is inherently high-risk, the use of milestones provides clear indicators of a project's continued success or emergent difficulties.</p>    <p>Milestones should describe the goal of the work and not just a statement that the work will be completed. Given the high-risk and progressive nature of therapeutics discovery and development, results at any stage of a project might indicate a dead end, for example a toxicology study may reveal that a molecule is unsuitable for human use. Thus, the milestone should indicate the desired outcome of a study and not simply that the study was conducted.&nbsp; The milestones must provide objective and quantitative outcomes by which to justify advancing the project.&nbsp; The criteria for success of the studies conducted should be objective measures. These should be measures that would be recognizable as appropriate endpoints in the specific scientific area. They should also have clear success criteria that can be used for evaluation by NIH. For examples of acceptable milestones, see&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Funding/Apply-Funding/Application-Support-Library/CounterACT-Milestone-Example"">CounterACT-Milestone-Example</a>.</p>    <p>Annual milestones may be modified in negotiations with NIH program officials before an initial award is made, and during the review of annual non-competitive applications.&nbsp; Unmet milestones and an incomplete data package that prevents an adequate interpretation of the results will have a negative impact on the review and approval of these annual non-competing applications. Partial budget reductions and/or restrictions in a given project year may also occur if certain aspects of the project are deemed futile, but others still show promise.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>G. Intellectual Property (IP)</strong></div>    <p>The NIH encourages the awardees and/or their collaborators to obtain and retain any IP developed around the therapy during the project period. Recipients of awards are encouraged to identify and foster relationships with potential licensing and commercialization partners early in the therapy development process. PDs/PIs are expected to work closely with their institutional technology transfer officials to ensure that royalty agreements, patent filings, and all other necessary IP arrangements are completed in a timely manner and that commercialization plans are developed and updated over the course of the project. It is recognized that in the case of medical countermeasures, commercialization may be challenging. Therefore, applicants are encouraged to discuss alternative strategies with NIH Scientific/Research staff to get further guidance.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>H. Research Topic Examples</strong></div>    <p>In general, the scope of research covered in this FOA can also be described by&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/federal-initiatives/guidance/integrated-trls.aspx"">Technology Readiness Levels</a>&nbsp;(TRLs). The TRLs covered in this FOA should fall between TRLs 3 through 5.</p>    <p>Specific examples of relevant research topics include but are not limited to those listed below:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Therapies based on acute toxicity of the chemical threat agent, e.g., new approaches to counteract neurological effects, pulmonary edema, relevant anti-inflammatory drugs, surfactants, antioxidants, the development of better skin and eye protectants.</li>    <li>Natural history animal models of the acute toxicity of chemical threat agents. These studies could include characterization of long-term effects after sub-lethal acute exposures to chemical threats agents, e.g., neuroprotectants for neurodegeneration and other neurological sequelae, drugs to prevent long-term pulmonary fibrosis, etc.</li>    <li>Studies relevant to the special vulnerabilities of pediatric populations and pregnant women as they relate to the development of therapeutics, e.g., acute effects on the developing brain that have long-term effects, the need for therapeutics dosing schedules and routes of administration that are more suitable for children and pregnant women.</li>    <li>Research on the molecular mechanisms of toxicity for the purpose of identifying novel targets, e.g., the mechanisms of nerve agent-induced long-term neurological effects or seizures with respect to temporal and regional changes, roles of cardiac versus neuronal mitochondria in cyanide toxicity, cellular and molecular basis for agent induced pulmonary edema.</li>    <li>Alternate routes of administration for new or approved therapies that would be safe, effective, and easy to administer during a mass casualty scenario, e.g., intramuscular route.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>I. Special Considerations</strong></div>    <div class=""heading4"">&nbsp;</div>    <p>Due to the urgency in need and the lengthy time and expense to bring a new compound to regulatory approval, applicants are encouraged to consider drugs that are already approved by the FDA for other indications, i.e., repurposing. Some of these drugs have been shown to be effective in treating victims of chemical exposures, and in some cases, the length of time to regulatory approval for a new indication may be shorter than for a new chemical entity. Applicants are strongly encouraged to work closely with their institutional technology transfer office to obtain and retain any IP developed around the proposed repurposing effort. Applicants are urged to contact the Scientific/Research Contacts listed in this FOA for more information related to the FDA as well as to seek out appropriate regulatory expertise in support of the proposed research.</p>    <p>This FOA will only support translational research that is clearly relevant to the development of therapeutics that will enhance our medical response capabilities during an emergency. New medical countermeasures that have no practical use during or shortly after a mass casualty situation are not appropriate for this FOA. Drugs only effective if given prior to chemical insult (prophylaxis), or those that must be given within a very short period (1-15 minutes) after the insult, will be of low priority. Since many chemical threats have rapid modes of action, the drug should act rapidly to counter these effects. The experimental design of proposed studies should be consistent with the timing and route of administration intended for use in humans during a chemical emergency. For example, drugs that are only effective when administered intravenously in the pre-hospital setting would be of low priority since their use would be impractical in a mass casualty situation. However, in some cases drugs may be given in-hospital to prevent long-term effects after acute exposures. Model development, screening activity and efficacy studies should be designed and justified with these ultimate requirements under consideration.</p>    <p>Special consideration will be given to research relevant to people who are particularly vulnerable, including the young, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing medical conditions. Pregnant women, infants and children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of chemical agents. Animal models and studies that address these vulnerabilities will be of high priority.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>J. Center Goals and Subprojects</strong></div>    <p>There should be a unifying well-defined goal or problem area of research to which each project relates and contributes, thereby producing a synergistic research environment that allows each research effort to share the resources and creative strengths of the others. There is the expectation that support of interrelated projects and collaborating investigators would yield results beyond those achievable if each project were pursued separately without formal interaction among the participating investigators. &nbsp;All investigators should contribute to, and share in, the responsibilities of fulfilling the Center objectives and milestones.</p>    <p>Milestones for the overall Center should be developed. These Center milestones should reflect the overall goals and objectives of the Center, and be supported by the milestones proposed in the subprojects. There may only be 3 or 4 Center milestones per year over the course of the entire project period.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>K. CounterACT Center Structure</strong></div>    <p>Each&nbsp;<a name=""_Hlk501373016""></a>CounterACT Research Center of Excellence&nbsp;should include the following components:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>one Administrative Core for Center Management and Operations,</li>    <li>three to five interrelated Research and Development Projects,</li>    <li>up to three Scientific Cores if needed and well justified, and</li>    <li>one Research Education Core.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>L.

The PD/PI is permitted but not required to be a subproject or core investigator.</li>    <li>The PD/PI and Administrative Core staff will be responsible for managing, coordinating, and supervising the entire range of Center activities, monitoring progress, and ensuring that a strategic plan is implemented in an effective and efficient manner. This may require both an Administrative and Scientific Program Manager to assist the PD/PI. The PD/PI and Administrative Core staff will be responsible for ensuring that appropriate systems are in place to provide for biosafety and security of materials, data, and facilities.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><strong>Research and Development Projects</strong></p>    <p>These projects should be scientifically linked. Examples of how these projects could be linked include:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>One effect: A single or multiple therapeutic(s) to treat a single type of effect, e.g., inflammation. This may include therapeutic(s) against one or multiple chemical agents that cause inflammation.</li>    <li>One chemical threat: A single or multiple therapeutic(s) to treat a single type of chemical threat, e.g. nerve agents. This may include therapeutic(s) against one or multiple kinds of effects caused by nerve agents (e.g., neurological, pulmonary, dermal).</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><strong>Scientific Core(s)</strong></p>    <p>Scientific Core facilities may be proposed if they will be utilized by at least two of the projects. Such core facilities should provide services that are already available, fully developed, and cannot be funded through other means for the purposes proposed.&nbsp; If subprojects are removed, replaced, or redirected during the funding period, core facility funds may be rebudgeted within the individual CounterACT Center upon approval by the NIH. Scientific Core facilities may include clinical, statistical, technical, or other supportive activities.</p>    <p><strong>Research Education</strong></p>    <p>One goal of the CounterACT program is to increase the number and capabilities of researchers and other personnel in applied toxicological research related to chemical threats. In general, the research education core should be multidisciplinary and provide short-term education for technicians, medical or graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and/or independent investigators, either within or beyond the CounterACT Center. Formal graduate programs are excluded from this FOA.</p>    <p>The proposed core should build on the strengths of the Center investigators, although outside instructors may be incorporated on occasion to provide cross-disciplinary depth.</p>    <p>Proposed activities within the core should facilitate the development of skills in the use of assays, methods, reagents, animal models, or technologies to develop new products through the regulatory process.</p>    <p><strong>Program Oversight</strong></p>    <p><em>CounterACT Center Steering Committee:</em></p>    <p>A Steering Committee for each CounterACT Center will make strategic decisions with regard to goals and research implementation of the Center to ensure that scientific milestones are met, resources are shared, and productive collaborations are established.

Applicants should contact NIH Scientific/Research staff at least 12 weeks before a due date.</p>"12899,Grant,"Behavioral and Social Intervention Clinical Trial Planning and Implementation Cooperative Agreement     <p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>    <p>The NIDCR recognizes that behavioral and social factors play a role in many dental, oral and craniofacial (DOC) disorders and conditions, and that behavioral and social interventions have the potential to improve these conditions by targeting key behavioral and social factors. The NIDCR is committed to supporting the development and testing of behavioral and social interventions to improve DOC health, and to supporting careful planning for these intervention studies. The purpose of this FOA is to provide support for planning and implementing well-designed, rigorously-conducted behavioral or social intervention studies relevant to DOC health. This FOA will support a broad range of DOC intervention research projects, for participants of any age or developmental stage; for any DOC condition with public health significance (e.g., dental caries, periodontal disease, craniofacial anomalies, oral cancers, salivary gland dysfunctions, oral mucosal diseases, orofacial pain); for a range of outcomes (e.g., direct intervention with patients to improve DOC outcomes, intervention with practitioners to improve DOC care, intervention on health systems to improve continuity of care); for stakeholders from different sectors (e.g., patients, families, social networks and communities, practitioners, care-delivery systems, professional organizations, policy-makers); and for DOC intervention research at all stages, from early intervention development (e.g., Stage I) through implementation and health services research (Stages IV/V).</p>    <p>This FOA is also meant to support basic behavioral and social sciences studies (e.g., Stage 0) that are considered clinical trials based on the NIH's revised definition (please see&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials.htm"">Clinical Trial Requirements for Grants and Contracts</a>,&nbsp; for guidance). Examples of such studies include experimental manipulation or laboratory-based studies in which behavioral or social probes are used to evoke participants' responses (e.g., emotional regulation, dental fear, social norms, pain intensity) under varied conditions, and for which proximal health-related behavioral or social outcomes&mdash;but not disease outcomes--are assessed. Such studies are sometimes referred to as Stage 0 studies, or Type 1 translation studies, or basic mechanistic studies. These studies now meet the NIH definition of a clinical trial, and so are appropriate for this FOA. All studies that involve prospective assignment of one or more participants to an intervention or experimental manipulation to study processes proximally or distally related to DOC health are appropriate for this FOA.</p>    <p>This FOA will not be used to support the testing of drugs, devices or biologics regulated by the FDA. Applicants interested in conducting such trials are encouraged to contact an NIDCR Program Official and to visit the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/Research/DER/ClinicalResearch/ClinTrials.htm"">NIDCR Clinical Trials Program website</a>.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><em>Background</em></div>    <p>The NIDCR behavioral and social sciences research program supports research consistent with two trans-NIH frameworks for approaching behavior change: the NIH Stage Model of intervention development, and the NIH Common Fund's Science of Behavior Change experimental medicine approach. Both frameworks emphasize the importance of understanding mechanisms of behavior change, as the building blocks of a cumulative science of behavior change, and as the essential elements of developing interventions and programs that can be adapted for sustainable delivery in their target settings.</p>    <p><strong>The NIH Stage Model of Intervention Development</strong></p>    <p>The Stage Model provides a framework for describing where an intervention is in the developmental pipeline, and specifies research activities appropriate for different stages of intervention development. For instance, the Stage Model describes different research activities that are typical in early intervention-development studies than are typical in effectiveness or implementation studies. The Stage Model also describes activities expected in all stages of intervention development, including the specification of hypothesized mechanisms of action of the intervention, and the inclusion of fidelity monitoring activities, although use of fidelity data may change with the stage of intervention development. The NIH Stage Model provides a common language that facilitates discussion of intervention development research by applicants, reviewers, and funders. Applications for NIDCR support of clinical trials research are expected to identify research proposals using the NIH Stage Model framework, described in detail at: https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dbsr/stage-model-behavioral-intervention-development.</p>    <p><strong>The NIH Common Fund's Science of Behavior Change Program</strong></p>    <p>The NIDCR behavioral and social sciences clinical research and clinical trials program also draws on the mechanisms-focused, experimental medicine approach encouraged by the NIH Common Fund's Science of Behavior Change (SOBC) program. The experimental medicine approach to behavior change research encourages clear a priori specification of the intended behavioral and social target(s) of an intervention, and methods that test the degree to which an experimental manipulation or intervention engaged those targets. The SOBC program describes 4 steps involved in the experimental medicine approach: 1) identifying one or more hypothesized intervention targets; 2) attempting to engage the target(s) through experimentation or intervention; 3) measuring the degree to which the experimental manipulation or intervention actually engaged the hypothesized target(s); and 4) testing the degree to which target engagement produces the desired change in health behaviors or clinical outcomes. For more information about the SOBC program, please see:&nbsp;<a href=""https://commonfund.nih.gov/behaviorchange"">https://commonfund.nih.gov/behaviorchange</a>. The purposes of this approach are to increase the contributions of each intervention study to a cumulative science of behavior change, to allow for mechanisms-based design of DOC behavior change interventions, and to facilitate testing of whether mechanisms-based interventions improve DOC health. Applications for NIDCR support of clinical trials research are expected to incorporate an experimental medicine approach. Applications that do not include an experimental medicine approach to behavior change must provide a strong justification for not doing so.</p>    <p>The experimental medicine approach is meant to be compatible with the NIH Stage Model of intervention development, and can be incorporated into any stage of intervention development. Examples of the experimental medicine approach in each stage include, but are not limited to:</p>    <p><strong>Stage 0 - (bBSSR)</strong>&nbsp;research is a natural fit for a mechanisms-focused, experimental medicine approach, already asking questions about the mechanisms of behavior and behavior change which could be the targets of subsequent interventions. Stage 0 research could identify and test hypothesized targets for future interventions, e.g., from epidemiologic, observational, or experimental manipulation studies. Stage 0 research could also develop measures of hypothesized mechanisms of change/subsequent intervention targets, and demonstrate that those measures assess change in the intended target. Note that descriptive studies demonstrating correlations among widely-studied risk and protective factors, that do not advance understanding of causal mechanisms, are of lower priority to the NIDCR.</p>    <p><strong>Stage I -&nbsp;</strong>(intervention generation and refinement) research incorporates the experimental medicine approach&nbsp;by specifying the intended intervention targets in an intervention manual, and by building into interventionist training materials and fidelity monitoring procedures a check on whether essential elements of the intervention were delivered as intended.</p>    <p><strong>Stages II (efficacy) and III (efficacy in the ""real world"")&nbsp;</strong>research offer an opportunity to implement the experimental medicine approach in fully-powered clinical trials. A typical example is an intervention study that specifies the intended intervention targets, delivers the intervention, measures the degree to which the intervention actually engaged the intended targets, and finally, measures the degree to which target engagement produced changes in the intended health behaviors or clinical condition(s). Note that measuring target engagement is highly dependent on the timing of measurement. For example, measuring whether an intervention engaged a behavioral target (e.g., self-efficacy, motivation) 6 months after intervention delivery is unlikely to capture target engagement. Also, direct measures of target engagement are likely to be more useful than proxy measures, e.g., if an intervention is meant to teach tooth brushing skills, a direct measure of target engagement would be the participants' tooth brushing skills, while an indirect measure would be a clinical indicator of dental or oral disease.</p>    <p><strong>Stages IV (effectiveness) and V (implementation)&nbsp;</strong>research apply the experimental medicine approach to hypothesized mechanisms of change in the service delivery system. Stage IV and V studies specify a priori hypotheses about the best strategies to implement evidence-based interventions in specific service delivery systems, implement those strategies, and use fidelity monitoring methods to understand the degree to which the hypothesized strategies led to successful implementation.</p>    <p><strong><em>Scope of this UG3/UH3 FOA</em></strong></p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li><strong>Clinical Trial Planning Phase (UG3)</strong></li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>The UG3 award will provide up to 2 years of support for scientific and operational planning activities necessary to conduct the clinical trial. The UG3 planning phase should incorporate all activities required&mdash;and not yet completed--to prepare for conduct of a subsequent clinical trial (i.e., intervention or experimental manipulation study).</p>    <p>When not yet already completed, at a minimum, UG3 planning activities should include the following activities, included as UG3 milestones:</p>    <p><strong>Development of NIDCR-required study documentation to ensure adherence to the principles of Good Clinical Practice</strong>&nbsp;(International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/.../Guidances/ucm073122.pdf"">http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/.../Guidances/ucm073122.pdf</a>). At a minimum, required documentation includes a clinical protocol, clinical quality management plan, data quality management plan, and participant consent/assent forms and procedures. For some studies, additional documentation may be required, for instance a Manual of Operations is typically required for multi-site studies where site-level procedures may vary. Applications should describe plans for developing relevant study documentation that will be required before progressing to the UH3 phase.</p>    <p><strong>Intervention target development:</strong>&nbsp;Applications should include plans for pilot testing to demonstrate that the hypothesized intervention targets can be engaged, and that target-engagement can be measured (i.e., Stage 0 activities, and first steps in the experimental medicine approach). For instance, if a study intends to test an intervention meant to increase self-efficacy for oral hygiene, the UG3 phase should demonstrate that the study intervention actually targets self-efficacy, and that changes in self-efficacy can be accurately measured.</p>    <p><strong>Acceptability and feasibility of the study intervention(s):</strong>&nbsp;If acceptability and/or feasibility of the intervention has not yet been established in the study population, the UG3 phase should propose activities necessary to ensure acceptability and feasibility. Relevant Stage I activities may include consultation with stakeholders, delivery of the intervention to gather feedback from participants and providers, and/or other activities.</p>    <p><strong>Acceptability and feasibility of study procedures:</strong>&nbsp;In addition to the acceptability and feasibility of the study intervention(s), planning activities should establish the acceptability and feasibility of proposed study procedures. If not already established, the UG3 planning phase should include pilot-testing of study procedures, such as participant recruitment, methods of data collection, interventionist training procedures, and other key aspects of study conduct.</p>    <p><strong>Fidelity monitoring procedures:&nbsp;</strong>Monitoring the degree to which a study intervention is delivered as it was intended to be delivered (i.e., with fidelity) is expected at every stage of intervention development; although the way fidelity data is used differs depending on the stage of intervention development and the associated research question(s). For instance, in stages of intervention development where efficacy is being established, fidelity monitoring is used to ensure intervention fidelity, and to identify interventionists who may need re-training. For studies in later stages of intervention development where efficacy has already been established, and research questions concern effectiveness or implementation, fidelity data is used to identify challenges to intervention delivery. If methods for monitoring the fidelity of intervention delivery are not already established, UG3 planning activities should include the development of these methods.</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li><strong>Clinical Trial Implementation Phase (UH3)</strong></li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>The objective of the Year 3 to Year 7 UH3 implementation phase is to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with activities planned in the UG3 phase.

The clinical trial must meet all applicable NIH, and Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) policy requirements.</p>    <p>At a minimum, UH3 activities should include the following operational activities, expressed as UH3 milestones:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Site activation</li>    <li>Enrollment of the first subject</li>    <li>If applicable, enrollment and randomization, of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the projected study population</li>    <li>Completion of data collection</li>    <li>Completion of primary study analyses</li>    <li>Completion of final study report</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><strong>UG3/UH3 Transition</strong></p>    <p>At the completion of the UG3 planning phase, the applicant will be required to submit a detailed transition request to progress to the UH3 clinical trial implementation phase. UH3 transition requests will undergo administrative review by NIH staff to determine whether the study will be awarded the implementation phase (UH3). Transition decisions will be based on success in meeting study milestones, readiness to conduct the UH3 clinical trial, feasibility of completing the UH3 clinical trial, availability of funds, and program priorities.</p>    <p>Prospective applicants should note that initial funding of the UG3/UH3 cooperative agreement does not guarantee support of the UH3 clinical trial implementation phase.&nbsp; UH3 funding is dependent on NIDCR program priorities and availability of funds. In addition, applicants should understand that transition to the UH3 phase of the project will occur only if the administrative review process determines that the UG3 planning milestones have been successfully met, and that the UH3 phase can proceed with confidence of success.</p>    <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p>    <p>Awardees are required to comply with the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/Research/ToolsforResearchers/Toolkit/NIDCRClinicalTermsofAward.htm?_ga=2.265852815.16116691.1504268189-122950086.1479241558"">NIDCR Clinical Terms of Award</a>&nbsp;for any planning phase activities that involve human subjects and all subsequent UH3 implementation phase studies.

Therefore, it may be possible to change the course of the disease by re-establishing self-tolerance. Autoimmune responses could be de-activated specifically and safely through the development of tolerizing ""vaccines"", or through the direct manipulation of cells and their microenvironments for anti-autoimmune effects.</p>    <p><strong>Research Goals and Objectives</strong></p>    <p>Therapeutic strategies to reverse new onset T1D by immunomodulatory drugs acting on effector and/or regulatory T cells have shown promise in phase 2 clinical trials. Other studies have begun to test whether cellular therapy (e.g., expanded and re-infused autologous regulatory T cells), or drugs capable of enhancing the survival and activity of endogenous regulatory cells can delay disease progression. Although the treatments so far have been safe, only a few have shown efficacy in terms of a delay in the decline of insulin production. Unfortunately, even in the case of detectable effect, most treated subjects continue to lose insulin production over time. This suggests that the interventions have not been potent or durable enough to stop the pathogenic process.</p>    <p>Several long-term trials have been conducted to prevent disease progression from early stages, and none have produced a primary positive result. These trials have employed very safe interventions, such as low doses of ingested or inhaled insulin peptide, or the feeding of hydrolyzed infant formula. In populations with Stage 1 disease (children with genetic risk, 2 or more different autoantibodies, 70% develop clinical symptoms in 10 years (JAMA. 2013;309(23):2473-2479)). &nbsp;Negative results suggest that more potent approaches for promoting or restoring immune tolerance may be needed for early stage intervention. Other trials are currently ongoing, for example, studies of immunomodulatory drugs that interfere with effector T cell activation or regulatory balance.</p>    <p>Increasing the potency or durability of immunomodulatory drugs could help, but these may have unacceptable longer-term safety risks. Antigen-specific or highly targeted interventions are most likely to have acceptable safety for T1D. Years of research have identified several autoantigens associated with T1D risk in humans. Recent studies demonstrate a role for post-translational modifications in producing potentially important antigens. Genetic studies have demonstrated that particular Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) alleles contribute very strongly to T1D susceptibility, while other MHC alleles provide protection. Many other genetic loci contribute lower risk, but combine to confer overall significant disease risk. The role of the microbiome in etiology and pathogenesis is under active investigation. Taken together, the current state of knowledge is important and will likely underpin successful approaches to prevent or reverse disease. This initiative will stimulate and support innovative, early stage research that seeks to develop antigen specific or highly targeted ways to control autoimmunity in T1D.</p>    <p><strong>Examples of possible projects include, but are not limited to:</strong></p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Development of tolerizing adjuvants or delivery systems (biomaterials, possibly nanoparticles) for inducing tolerance to autoantigens in T1D.</li>    <li>Research focused on approaches to directly and specifically intervene in autoimmune pathogenic processes relevant to T1D:</li>    <li class=""P_DoubleIndent"">Engineering immune cells for use as highly specific therapeutics in T1D.</li>    <li class=""P_DoubleIndent"">Re-directing effector immune cells to eliminate pathogenic cell types.</li>    <li class=""P_DoubleIndent"">Re-directing or strengthening immune regulatory cells to dampen the overactive immune system at sites of autoimmune damage.</li>    <li class=""P_DoubleIndent"">Remodeling the microbiome for the purposes of altering immune system balance away from pathogenesis in T1D.</li>    <li class=""P_DoubleIndent"">Manipulating mucosal associated lymphoid tissue</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>Research that uses T1D-relevant humanized pre-clinical models, for example to explore opportunities for intervention at different disease stages, or to account for mechanistic heterogeneity, is encouraged.

Each SCORE will serve as a National resource focused on translational research at multiple levels of analysis to identify the role of biological sex differences on the health of women. Centers of Excellence will also serve as vital hubs for education and dissemination of innovative sex-based and informed translational research methods and best practices. In addition, they will provide leadership in the development and promotion of standards and policies for the consideration of sex differences in biomedical research.&nbsp; The contributions of biological sex can assist in understanding the diversity of health outcomes, and this knowledge can be applied to the development of the next generation of interventions and medical treatments leading to improvements in women's health.</p>    <p>It is expected that SCORE Centers will:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Develop or strengthen awardee institutions' programs that focus and sustain progress on a key area in women's health research.</li>    <li>Provide intellectual leadership and innovation to advance research that elucidates the role of sex differences on the health of men and women;</li>    <li>Facilitate and develop novel interdisciplinary research strategies;</li>    <li>Stimulate incorporation of emerging technologies, methods and scientific advances into research designs as appropriate;</li>    <li>Provide research &nbsp;career enhancement opportunities in sex differences research;</li>    <li>Stimulate translation between basic and clinical research, e.g., research to develop or test interventions or diagnostic tests based on findings from basic research;</li>    <li>Collaborate with other SCOREs on projects such as integrating data systems, supporting multi-center observational studies;</li>    <li>Interface where possible with other NIH-funded programs and centers; and</li>    <li>Leverage institutional resources.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><strong>Background</strong></p>    <p>The ORWH serves as a focal point for women's health research at the National Institutes of Health (<a href=""https://www.nih.gov/"">NIH</a>). The ORWH works in partnership with the NIH Institutes, Centers and Offices, as well as with federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, to ensure that women's health research is an integral part of the scientific framework throughout the scientific community.</p>    <p>The Specialized Centers of Research (SCOR) program, a predecessor to the Specialized Centers of Research Excellence (SCORE) program represented by this FOA, was first announced by ORWH (in partnership with the FDA) in 2002 to support research to understand and explore the continuous interaction between sex and gender, human health that is determined by both biology and expression of gender. Sex and gender are important considerations in many areas of research, including basic biological, psychological, social, and behavioral studies. The consideration of these variables and comparisons of males and females are critical to the accurate interpretation, validation, and generalization of research findings in biomedical research. Sex and gender may also determine how health and disease processes differ among women, or between women and men, and inform the development and testing of preventive and therapeutic interventions in both sexes. Sex-based comparisons in research may also ensure that findings are applicable to both women and men. The SCOR specialized centers were thus established to 1) expedite interdisciplinary development and application of new knowledge to human diseases that affect women, 2) Learn more about etiology of these diseases, and 3) Foster improved approaches to treatment and prevention.</p>    <p><a name=""_Hlk490145352""></a>The SCOR program represents an innovative interdisciplinary research program focusing on sex differences and major medical conditions affecting women in the U.S., and supports established scientists at centers across the country who conduct ground breaking research that integrates basis, clinical, and behavioral research approaches to incorporate sex differences.&nbsp;ORWH committed $10 million initially to fund 9-10 Specialized Centers (P50 grants). Eleven centers were co-funded with the help of a number of NIH IC partners and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. To date, a total of 32 SCORs have been funded with an investment of over $132 million providing support at 21 US institutions. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p>An outcome evaluation of the SCOR program, completed in 2017 found the SCOR program to be fully successful in accomplishing its stated goals. Moreover, the SCOR program goals were on the leading edge of the need for renewed focus on research on sex differences. In a 2014 Nature&nbsp;<a title=""Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"" href=""http://www.nature.com/news/policy-nih-to-balance-sex-in-cell-and-animal-studies-1.15195"">commentary</a>,&nbsp; NIH leadership called attention to a lack of knowledge about the influence of biological sex in preclinical research. In particular, an overreliance on male animals and cells in basic and preclinical research may obscure key sex differences that could guide clinical studies. Inadequate specification of the sex of cells, inadequate inclusion of female animals in experiments, and inadequate analysis and reporting of data by sex, may also contribute to irreproducibility of preclinical biomedical research. Additional information can be found in the article ""<em>Studying both sexes: a guiding principle for biomedicine</em>"" published by Dr. Janine Clayton in&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26514164"">FASEB J, 2016</a>.</p>    <p>To advance the consideration of sex and other biological variables, NIH adopted a new policy in January 25, 2016, ""Enhancing Reproducibility through Rigor and Transparency"" (<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-103.html"">NOT-OD-15-103</a>), which mandated that investigators provide scientific justification of Sex as a Biological Variable (SABV).&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-102.html"">NOT-OD-15-102</a>&nbsp;provides specific guidance regarding SABV.</p>    <p>The ORWH SCOR program then, has been at the forefront of sex differences research and SCOR investigators have made seminal contributions to the study of sex differences that affect women's health. With this FOA, ORWH is leveraging 15 years of investment in the study of sex differences and building upon advances in the field by expanding the SCOR program to add the expectation of excellence with the establishment of the Specialized Centers of Research Excellence (SCORE).</p>    <p>Guided by current research, as well as the input we received from the evaluation and from &nbsp;stakeholders, the next generation SCORE program will have an enhanced focus on 1) translational science with the goal of translating biomedical discoveries into clinical applications that improve the health of women and 2) education, to disseminate innovative translational research methods and best practices; and provide leadership in the development and promotion of standards and policy for the consideration of sex differences in biomedical research.</p>    <p><strong><em>Overview of Centers of Excellence</em></strong></p>    <p>The objective of the SCORE program is to expedite the development and application of new knowledge to human diseases that affect women, to learn more about the etiology of these diseases, and to foster improved approaches to treatment and/or prevention.</p>    <p>Applicants to this FOA should develop a translational research program in an area of research that considers sex differences underlying women's health issues. The translational science spectrum represents each stage of research along the path from the biological basis of health and disease to interventions that improve the health of individuals and the public. The spectrum is not linear or unidirectional; each stage builds upon and informs the others. The path from the biological basis of health and disease to interventions that improve health, encompassing: Basic Research, Pre-Clinical Research, Clinical Research, Clinical Implementation, and Public Health.&nbsp; For more information, please see&nbsp;<a href=""https://ncats.nih.gov/translation/spectrum"">Translational Science Spectrum</a>&nbsp;on the National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) website. SCORE applications can support: patient-oriented research, including epidemiological and behavioral studies or outcomes research or research conducted with human subjects (or on material of human origin such as tissues, specimens and cognitive phenomena) for which an investigator (or colleague) directly interacts with human subjects. Excluded from this definition are in-vitro studies that utilize human tissues that cannot be linked to a living individual.&nbsp; Applicants proposing clinical trials should consult ORWH program staff prior to submission of their applications.</p>    <p>With increasing understanding of the inter-relatedness and complexity of disease, the nature of scientific investigation is shifting to an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach. Interdisciplinary approaches can integrate knowledge from multiple specialties and disciplines, thus enhancing the likelihood of defining underlying pathologic processes. SCORE applicants are expected to employ interdisciplinary research approaches, recognizing the complex interplay of factors that impact the health of women. Collaborations among researchers in academia, private industry, and federal settings should be leveraged, as appropriate to advance the SCORE research program. Although the focus of the SCORE program is on sex differences, research programs are not required to have both male and female cohorts. However, if female only research is proposed, the background section must include the current state of knowledge and review of the literature justifying that studies will include cohorts of women only, consistent with the NIH inclusion policy. This FOA allows applications for women's health research relevant to the mission of the participating NIH ICs (see below: Research Areas of Interest).</p>    <p>Prospective applicants are urged to consult with the Scientific/Research Contacts of the NIH early in the preparation of the application (see&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-OD-08-001.html#SectionVII"">Section VII. Agency Contacts</a>).</p>    <p><em>Research Projects: required</em></p>    <p>A SCORE program consists of at least three-individual, but interrelated, research projects, each with high scientific merit. The overall program should have clear translational research objectives and, in the aggregate, be devoted to a specific major health area relevant to women's health and to incorporate sex as a biological variable (SABV) when planning, analyzing, and reporting data.</p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent"">For the purposes of this FOA only Phase 0 or Phase I Phase II may be supported. SCORE Centers are strongly encouraged to establish collaborative clinical trial activities early in the development of projects that have clinical trials/studies as their goals.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p>In addition, a SCORE program must have a Leadership Administrative core (LAC), and a Career Enhancement Core (CEC).</p>    <p><em>Leadership Administrative Core (LAC): required</em></p>    <p>A Leadership Administrative Core (LAC) must be included for the SCORE program. The LAC will (1) monitor, stimulate, evaluate, and report on the research projects and educational programs particularly with respect to the overall goals of the SCORE; and (2) Provide Intellectual leadership in support of the activities of the SCORE consortium.</p>    <p>The SCORE PD/PI or his/her designee will have overall responsibility for the LAC.</p>    <p>Annual meetings of the SCORE Directors will be held. Planning and execution of annual meetings will be shared between the ORWH, NIH ICs Program Staff, and the Steering Committee. By providing a focused and interactive agenda, the annual meeting fosters the initiation and maintenance of collaborative efforts and resource sharing among the Centers. SCORE PD/PIs should budget funds for the DP/PI and one to -two designees to attend an annual two-day meeting.</p>    <p>Awarded SCOREs are expected to actively participate in the organization and programmatic objectives of a research consortium. The goal of the consortium is to share expertise, research results and identify emergent issues, new research opportunities and establish research priorities and collaborations on conditions underlying women's health issues. The SCORE research consortium will also serve as a vehicle for collaborating on education and career enhancement initiatives and the promotion of diversity in the translational science workforce.</p>    <p><em>Career Enhancement Core (CEC): required&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>    <p>A Career Enhancement Core (CEC) must be proposed as part of this FOA. The goal of the CEC is to meet the career enhancement needs of translational science in the study of sex differences. As a required element of the SCORE, the CEC must be maintained throughout the entire term of the funding period. Funds from this program may be used to support junior faculty or established investigators who wish to enhance or refocus their careers on translational research. Investigators supported by NIH career development award (K series) may also be eligible for support through this program. Early Stage Investigators and Early-Established Investigators are highly encouraged to apply. Pilot studies and complementary education programs should provide opportunities in rigorous research methodologies and transparency in experimental design and reporting. The CEC should provide unique opportunities to understand women's health and to incorporate sex as a biological variable (SABV) when planning, analyzing, and reporting data. This funding opportunity also seeks to facilitate educational opportunities of participants. Participants from diverse backgrounds, underrepresented in the biomedical science are especially encouraged. Current estimates regarding the state of health of US women are variable, with many health, disease, mortality and morbidity outcomes differing significantly by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Training a diverse biomedical workforce will enhance the scope of intellectual capacity brought to bear on intransigent issues of health and disease to positively affect the health of all women.&nbsp;</p>    <p><em>Resource Support Core(s) (RSC): optional</em></p>    <p>SCORE applicants may propose one or more Resource Support Core(s) (RSC) to support two or more research projects, e.g., animal, pathology, and or informatics.

Gaza is a dry area and the local aquifer recharge is very limited (55-60 Mm3 /year on average). Extraction by all users (Israelis, Egyptians and Palestinians) already far exceeds natural recharge. Consequently, the aquifer has been depleted and suffers from seawater intrusion.</p>    <p>The humanitarian situation in Gaza deteriorated dramatically during 2017 in large part fueled by an electricity crisis that exacerbated protracted vulnerable humanitarian conditions and resulted in an accelerated aggravation in health services, further reducing water supply and the operation of critical water and sanitation facilities. The power supply decreased from an average of 10-12 hours during 2016 to just 4-6 hours per day during 2017, following the Palestinian Authority&rsquo;s decision to cut payments for the electricity supplied to Gaza by Israel. As a result of the electricity shortage, domestic water supply has declined by more than 30% compared with the first quarter of 2017; the daily average dropped from 84 to 60 litres per person, well below the minimum recommendation of 100 litres. Similarly, the pollution levels of sewage discharged into the Mediterranean, more than 100 million litres every day, increased by 37%.6 UN-OCHA&rsquo;s Humanitarian Response Plan 2018-2020 (HRP 2018)7 addresses needs identified in the Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO 2018),8 including needs in the WASH sector.</p>    <p>According to the HNO 2018 about 1.46 M people are in need of WASH related activities in Gaza.</p>    <p>A snapshot of USAID&rsquo;s interventions in the water sector:</p>    <p>USAID generates tangible benefits in the lives of Palestinians by increasing access to clean, reliable and affordable water and energy and stimulating the growth of the Palestinian economy.

A diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce will also improve global competitiveness, contribute to robust learning environments, and enhance public trust.</p>    <p>The United States has seen an increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees in the biomedical sciences earned by scientists from backgrounds and groups traditionally underrepresented in the biomedical sciences (Gibbs, et al., 2016, eLife 2016;5:e21393); however, the attrition of scientists from underrepresented groups from biomedical research pathways continues to be an issue (Valantine, Lund &amp; Gammie, CBE-Life Sciences Education, 2016, 15:fe4, 1-5).</p>    <p>With the recognized need to enhance diversity in the biomedical research workforce, the NIH Director requested input from the NIH Advisory Committee to the Director (ACD) regarding actions that the NIH should take to make transformative progress in this area. In 2012, the ACD Working Group on Diversity in the Biomedical Research Workforce explored ways to improve the recruitment of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-129.html"">underrepresented</a>&nbsp;in biomedical research and methods to sustain their interest in and prepare them for successful biomedical research careers. The Working Group provided recommendations, endorsed by the ACD, about ways to develop and support individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-129.html"">underrepresented</a>&nbsp;in the biomedical sciences, throughout their research career (from undergraduate study to acquisition of tenure in an academic position or the equivalent in a non-academic setting). In response to these recommendations, the NIH established the Common Fund Program ""Enhancing the Diversity of the NIH-Funded Workforce,&rdquo; also known as the Diversity Program Consortium (DPC).</p>    <p>The first phase of the Enhancing the Diversity of the NIH-Funded Workforce Common Fund program allowed for the formation of a national consortium through which awardee institutions, in partnership with the NIH, began implementing and evaluating training and mentoring programs&nbsp;to engage individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-129.html"">underrepresented</a>&nbsp;in the biomedical sciences and help them prepare for and succeed in biomedical research careers. The DPC was developed in the context of existing programs through which NIH and other entities have made significant investments to engage scientists and institutions using a variety of training, mentoring, and research capacity-building approaches. Although these programs have shown positive outcomes for trainees and participants, data on the specific factors that contribute to successful outcomes is limited. The primary goal of the DPC is to provide robust evidence on effective ways to engage and sustain the interest of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-129.html"">underrepresented</a>&nbsp;groups in the biomedical research workforce, and to encourage the dissemination of successful interventions to a wide variety of institutions across the United States.</p>    <p>The first phase of the program provided an opportunity to establish the types of interventions and evaluative frameworks needed to begin understanding and addressing multi-dimensional factors that strongly influence success.&nbsp;The DPC implemented interventions and evaluative practices designed to understand effective approaches to mentoring, student engagement, research capacity building, faculty development, and infrastructure development. The interventions were designed around the following questions:</p>    <ul>    <li>What are the hallmarks of a successful biomedical research career at each phase of the training process?</li>    <li>What motivates students to enter biomedical research career paths, and what factors contribute to their sustained participation?</li>    <li>What factors influence&nbsp;emerging scientists from diverse backgrounds, including those from&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-129.html"">underrepresented</a>&nbsp;groups, to enter, exit, or sustain a biomedical research career, and how can these factors be addressed?</li>    <li>What must happen during different training stages to ensure that trainees from diverse background, including those from&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-129.html"">underrepresented</a>&nbsp;groups, develop the skills, knowledge, and competencies essential to successful biomedical careers, and careers in the NIH-funded biomedical research workforce?</li>    <li>How do institutional structures and resources facilitate successful research training and professional development activities?</li>    </ul>    <p>The second, and final, phase of this program will allow the DPC to continue gathering data required to address the questions listed above and to assess the longer-term outcomes. During this phase, grantees are expected to refine their approaches and evaluations and to focus on sustainability and dissemination of successful interventions to enhance diversity in the biomedical research workforce. Additional relevant questions for the final phase include, but are not limited to:</p>    <ul>    <li>How can training, mentoring, and research capacity interventions to enhance diversity be institutionalized so that their impact continues beyond the period of funding from the NIH Common Fund?</li>    <li>How can successful approaches to enhance diversity be widely disseminated to other institutions to provide maximum impact at a national level?</li>    </ul>    <p>The program consists of three highly integrated initiatives, in which awardees work together as the Diversity Program Consortium. The three components are described below.</p>    <p><em>The Building Infrastructure Leading to Diversity (BUILD) Initiative:</em></p>    <p>The BUILD initiative was designed to allow sites to implement and study innovative approaches to engaging and sustaining the interest of trainees from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-129.html"">underrepresented</a>&nbsp;in biomedical research, potentially helping them on the pathway to become future contributors to the NIH-funded research enterprise. BUILD sites were also funded to implement interventions at the faculty and institutional levels to maximize opportunities for faculty development and research capacity building. An integral component of the BUILD initiative is the long-term evaluation of the interventions. In the first phase, awardees were selected because they identified needs at their institutions and proposed robust approaches to understanding how certain interventions could enhance the diversity of the biomedical research workforce. In the second phase, awardees demonstrating rigorous preliminary results will continue to evaluate the interventions to understand the longer-term impact of the programs and will continue to focus on building research capacity to successfully compete for research and training grants. Awardee institutions are also expected to develop sustainability plans and dissemination methods, which will broaden the Diversity Program Consortium&rsquo;s impact to non-BUILD institutions, and provide more institutions with opportunities to increase the persistence of biomedical trainees from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-129.html"">underrepresented</a>&nbsp;groups, and enhance the research capacity in biomedical research-related fields.</p>    <p><em>The National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN) Consortium:</em></p>    <p>Mentorship is crucial in the development of any scientist&rsquo;s career; however, the ACD Working Group on Diversity noted that the community lacks evidence on how to promote successful mentoring relationships for trainees from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-129.html"">underrepresented</a>&nbsp;backgrounds. The NRMN was developed to understand the elements that contribute to productive mentoring relationships for individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-129.html"">underrepresented</a>&nbsp;groups, and to develop mentoring tools and resources across the national community of researchers in the biomedical research workforce.</p>    <p><a name=""_Hlk498341862""></a>During the first phase of the program, the NRMN was tasked with developing a highly networked set of motivated and skilled mentors from various disciplines linked to mentees across the country. In addition, the NRMN cores were selected to provide training opportunities for mentors, to facilitate networking and professional opportunities, and to collect data on effective practices for mentoring. As part of the Diversity Program Consortium, the NRMN contributed to the development of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nigms.nih.gov/training/dpc/Pages/success.aspx"">hallmarks of success</a>&nbsp;and participated in data collection in collaboration with the Coordination and Evaluation Center (CEC).</p>    <p><a name=""_Hlk498341838""></a>In the second phase of the program, the NRMN initiative will continue to develop mentoring and networking opportunities for biomedical researchers from diverse backgrounds, including those from&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-129.html"">underrepresented</a>&nbsp;groups, from undergraduates through early career faculty. To broaden the number of innovative strategies explored and increase the likelihood of impact, sustainability, and dissemination, the NRMN will be organized as a consortium of independent research projects, a Resource Center, and a Coordinating Center. The NRMN Coordinating and Resource Centers will work with the independent research projects to enhance dissemination and to promote synergies to provide evidence and resources for effective mentoring to enhance the diversity of the biomedical research workforce. The NRMN Coordination Center will coordinate data collection and storage with the CEC, and build upon and improve instruments and processes developed in the first funding period.</p>    <p><em>The Coordination and Evaluation Center (CEC):</em></p>    <p>The scale of the DPC&rsquo;s scientific approach necessitated a center to coordinate the consortium-wide evaluation and data collection efforts, and to store the vast amount of data collected. During the first phase, the CEC was responsible for coordinating consortium-wide activities and working with the BUILD and NRMN programs to develop site-specific and consortium-wide&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nigms.nih.gov/training/dpc/Pages/success.aspx"">hallmarks of success</a>, robust evaluation plans, and the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nigms.nih.gov/training/dpc/Pages/datasharing.aspx"">data sharing agreement</a>. These consortium--wide development activities were established through consensus in Executive Steering Committee meetings (See&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-18-005.html#_Section_VI._Award"">Section VI</a>&nbsp;for details about the Executive Steering Committee). The CEC coordinated the clearance through the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to allow for the secure collection and reporting of data from BUILD and NRMN awardees. The CEC also facilitated consortium-wide working groups, meetings, discussions of approaches, progress, and lessons learned.</p>    <p>The CEC&rsquo;s evaluation activities and coordination responsibilities will continue in the second phase of the program. The consortium-wide hallmarks and consortium-wide evaluation plans will be maintained during the second phase, and the CEC will work closely with BUILD and NRMN awardees to gather data and conduct program evaluations. In addition, the CEC will increase outreach and dissemination of successful interventions.</p>    <p>The long-term impact of this catalytic, trans-NIH program will be in the broad dissemination of effective, evidence-based training and mentoring strategies. The DPC&rsquo;s method of taking a scientific approach to understand training interventions is an innovative design that is likely to serve as a model for biomedical training programs across the Nation.</p>    <div class=""heading4"">Purpose/ Objectives</div>    <p>The objective of this funding opportunity announcement is to invite an application from the Program Directors/Principal Investigators of the CEC, which is currently supporting the research being performed by the members of the DPC. The CEC will continue to coordinate the activities of the consortium to ensure that all BUILD and NRMN awardees address the DPC goals and objectives. The CEC will conduct evaluation activities to confirm that each of the training and mentoring interventions is assessed with respect to agreed-upon principles, that different approaches may be compared, and that lessons learned are disseminated.</p>    <p>The CEC will work collaboratively with DPC awardees to 1) identify fundamental attributes of successful biomedical researchers; 2) identify metrics for site-specific goals; 3) assess the impact of approaches used by each site on the attainment of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nigms.nih.gov/training/dpc/Pages/success.aspx"">hallmarks of success</a>; 4) coordinate data acquisition across sites; and 5) disseminate consortium-endorsed practices and lessons learned to transform training and mentoring programs across the nation. The CEC will also provide administrative support for the Executive Steering Committee and its subcommittees, and coordinate the annual grantees meeting and other consortium-wide activities as required. (See Section VI for details about the Executive Steering Committee.)</p>    <p>The CEC will continue to work collaboratively with DPC awardees to design meaningful ways to assess the impact of approaches tailored toward the individual environments as well as those intended to address consortium-wide goals. The consortium will strive to enhance training and engagement at awardee institutions, modify approaches as needed to increase the overall impact, and support awardee cooperation and sharing of effective practices.</p>    <p>The leadership and key personnel of the CEC are expected to have broad experience working collaboratively to assess and evaluate biomedical research training and mentoring activities, including those involving nationally&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-129.html"">underrepresented</a>&nbsp;student groups. The ability to work collaboratively with multiple communities while providing strong leadership in evaluative activities is a requirement. The CEC must also include individuals with expertise in multi-site evaluation as well as in coordination, communication, and consensus-building among diverse groups of stakeholders. The CEC should also include individuals with knowledge and expertise regarding factors that contribute to decisions to pursue, or not to pursue, biomedical research careers and the current evidence base related to training and mentoring practices and approaches to evaluate them.</p>    <p><strong>The CEC will conduct the following activities:</strong></p>    <ul>    <li>Maintaining, refining and revising standardized evaluation approaches and data collection protocols for the DPC that include individual and institutional demographic characteristics, nature of participation in the DPC, and achievement of training and career milestones.</li>    <li>Identifying, refining and developing instruments designed to assess participants' perceptions and attitudes towards biomedical research and to assess the attainment of the DPC&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nigms.nih.gov/training/dpc/Pages/success.aspx"">hallmarks of success</a>.

The FOA solicits applications that involve collaboration among cancer control researchers and those from scientific disciplines not traditionally connected to cancer control applications (e.g., affective and cognitive neuroscience, decision science, consumer science) to elucidate perplexing and understudied problems in affective and decision sciences with downstream implications for cancer prevention and control.<br />&nbsp;<br />Projects should leverage classic and contemporary experimental designs and methodological paradigms to expand our understanding of affective and decisional processes that contribute to cancer risk and outcomes. Proposals are encouraged to incorporate more than one operationalization of affect (e.g., fMRI, brain lesion, physiological assessment, self-report, induction). The FOA engages scientists with expertise not traditionally brought to bear on cancer control research. As such, there is a need for substantial partnership with co-investigators and other key personnel with expertise in cancer control. Projects proposed by collaborative teams of affective and cancer control scientists and submitted as multiple principal investigator (MPI) applications are strongly encouraged.<br />&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Background and Rationale</strong></p>    <p>Decisions about health and health behaviors confer significant risks and benefits along the cancer control continuum. Informed by decades of basic and translational evidence, behavioral science efforts to reduce the cancer burden have historically targeted risk perception and social normative determinants of such decisions and behaviors. Those investments have yielded actionable findings. However, new knowledge is needed to optimize individual and group decision making relevant to cancer risk and outcomes. Recently converging evidence demonstrates affect is a pervasive&ndash; sometimes harmful and sometimes beneficial &ndash; determinant of decision making, with multiple mechanisms of influence and means for intervention. Association studies implicate affective states in cancer-related information processing; decisions about cancer risk and prevention behaviors (e.g., smoking, overeating, cancer screening, HPV vaccination); decisions about treatment and treatment adherence; and decisions about palliative and end-of-life care.&nbsp; However, our understanding of how emotions influence single and multiple event decisions relevant to cancer prevention and control is in its infancy.<br />&nbsp;<br />Without improvements in basic knowledge about how affect influences individual and collective cancer-related behavioral decision making, efforts to develop, test, and disseminate cancer control and biomedical interventions to reduce cancer risk, incidence, morbidity and mortality are hampered. Importantly, the influence of emotion is highly context-specific, highlighting the critical need for elucidating the role of emotion in cancer-specific decision making to maximize the ability to translate advances in affective science into objective and measurable improvements in cancer control.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Specific Research Objectives</strong></div>    <p>Specific gaps in our knowledge with important downstream implications for cancer control include, but are not limited to: &nbsp;</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>How does affect contribute to decisions to adhere to recommendations for biomedical treatments or interventions, such as HPV vaccination or cancer treatments?</li>    <li>How do emotions influence patient-provider interactions and clinical encounters? How does the emotional tenor of such interactions influence shared decision making surrounding cancer screening or treatment?</li>    <li>What are the neuropsychological underpinnings of craving for cigarettes or highly palatable foods? Can we identify patterns of stimuli that trigger affective craving responses so future communication efforts do not inadvertently elicit those responses?</li>    <li>How do specific positive (e.g., pride) and negative (e.g., anger) emotions facilitate decision making about cancer risk and prevention behaviors with short-term costs but long-term gains, such as exercise or quitting smoking? How does emotion regulation modify associations between these emotions and cancer risk behaviors?</li>    <li>How does emotion influence sensitivity to risk, particularly in the context of prognostic uncertainty?</li>    <li>How does emotion contribute to decision to seek treatment or palliative care under ambiguous circumstances?</li>    <li>How can we best measure affect in cancer decision contexts involving healthy individuals, and those at increased risk for cancer, diagnosed with cancer, in treatment for cancer, in palliative care, and/ or in cancer survivorship?</li>    <li>What are the implications of ""blended"" emotional states (e.g., being happy about the ability to express sadness, experiencing both anger and fear in concert)?

Almost 16,000 people in the U.S. lived with ALS in 2013 and most people die within two to five years of being diagnosed with the disease (Mehta, 2016). Approximately 5-10% of all ALS cases can be attributed to familial, or heritable, genetic mutations. However, the majority of ALS cases are sporadic, for which the underlying cause(s) are largely unknown, and for which a complex set of risk factors may interact to produce clinical disease (Wang, 2016; Al-Chalabi, 2013; Wingo, 2011).</p>    <p>Studies have evaluated possible ALS risk factors including familial and sporadic genetic susceptibility, employment in certain occupations, exposure to heavy metals, cyanotoxins and infectious agents, physical activity, and trauma (Sutedja, 2009; Factor-Litvak, 2013; Bettencourt, 2015; Bradley, 2013; Watanabe, 2017; Pupillo, 2017; Fang, 2011). Recent studies have shown that military veterans may be at a higher risk for developing ALS than the general population; while the reason for increased ALS risk among veterans is unknown, it is thought that selective environmental exposures may play a part in the disease's development (Oskarsson, 2015; Weisskopf, 2005).Participation by athletes in certain sports has also been associated with an increased risk of developing ALS; however it is unclear if the association is tied to the prevalence of repeated concussions or clinical misdiagnoses (e.g., ALS v. chronic traumatic encephalopathy) (Lehman EJ, 2012). Additional research is needed to investigate the risk factors and etiology of ALS, especially in military, sports, or trauma contexts, to better understand ALS pathophysiology.</p>    <p>The uncertainty about the incidence and prevalence of ALS, as well as the lack of knowledge about the etiology of the disease, created a need for structured data collection. The ALS Registry Act (H.R. 2295), passed in October 2008, amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of DHHS, acting through the Director of CDC, to (1) develop a system to collect data on ALS; and (2) establish a national registry for the collection and storage of ALS data. In October 2010, the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) launched the National ALS Registry to collect data that would:</p>    <ul>    <li>describe the incidence and prevalence of ALS in the United States;</li>    <li>examine factors, including environmental and occupational, that might be associated with the disease;</li>    <li>better outline key demographic factors (such as age, race or ethnicity, gender, and family history of individuals who are diagnosed with the disease) associated with the disease; and</li>    <li>facilitate examination of the connection between ALS and other motor neuron disorders that can be confused with ALS, misdiagnosed as ALS, and in some cases progress to ALS.</li>    </ul>    <p>National ALS Registry data are available for researchers to identify potential risk factors for ALS. The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to solicit investigatorinitiated research that will further the understanding of potential risk factors for ALS, while supporting the National ALS Registry's mission. Information gleaned from this investigatorinitiated research will provide a greater understanding of the etiology and epidemiology of ALS and help ATSDR prioritize topics for future research initiatives and updated National ALS Registry risk factor surveys. Examples of ALS research previously funded by ATSDR can be found at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/als/ALSExternalResearchfundedbyRegistry.aspx. The intended results expected as a consequence of research funded under this announcement are listed in more detail in the Objectives/Outcomes section of this document.</p>    <p>Research funded under this NOFO is expected to produce outcomes that will identify potential risk factors for ALS, so that ATSDR can estimate the number of new ALS cases each year, estimate the number of people who have ALS at a specific point in time, better understand who gets ALS, and identify what contributing factors, including environmental, may affect ALS.</p>"13075,Grant,"Increase the Capacity of the Health System to Deliver Quality Essential Health Services <p>The ACCESS activity aims to support activities that will contribute to USAID/Madagascar's five-year (2016-2020) Health Development Objective (DO) focused on &ldquo;sustainable health impacts accelerated for Malagasy People.&rdquo; By building upon the successes and lessons learned from USAID&rsquo;s health programs Mikolo, MAHEFA, Mahefa Miaraka, and Maternal and Child Survival Program (MCSP), this activity will increase the capacity of the Malagasy health system to deliver quality essential health services to rural and urban populations. The activity will strengthen the service delivery continuum through community health volunteers (CHVs), primary health facilities or Centre de Sant&eacute; de Base (CSBs), and district hospitals by improving clinical and non-clinical skills of health providers and through focused efforts to strengthen health systems at the district level and below. The activity will also engage with regional health authorities to ensure coordination and effective management of health activities in their districts. Work at the national level will focus on the development of in-service training curricula for health providers and development of performance improvement and quality assurance measures. In addition, ACCESS will work to develop healthy norms and health seeking behaviors and build the capacity of Malagasy institutions to lead and coordinate social and behavior change activities.</p>    <p>Madagascar is a country of enormous potential, yet it faces formidable social and economic development challenges. Prior to the 2009 political crisis, Madagascar experienced relatively strong economic performance and was on track to meet several of its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). However, following the political crisis, most donors, including the United States Government (USG), imposed restrictions on development assistance. This effectively halted development and investments in the country. The percentage of the Malagasy population living on under $1.90 per day in 2012 was nearly 78 percent . Madagascar&rsquo;s progress on health indicators faltered and, in some cases, reversed. It wasn&rsquo;t until 2014 that the USG lifted sanctions on the Government of Madagascar (GOM) and, in the case of the health sector, bolstered its efforts to improve the public health system.</p>    <p>The GOM&rsquo;s global vision is that &ldquo;By 2030, the entire population is healthy, lives in a safe environment, and has a better and productive life&rdquo;. The Ministry of Public Health&rsquo;s (MOPH) National Health Sector Development Plan or Plan de D&eacute;veloppement du Secteur Sant&eacute; (PDSS) for 2015-2019 outlines consensus-driven and evidence-based priorities and objectives and defines expected results, strategies, and interventions to achieve the objectives. The plan identifies the following focus areas: (1) governance and leadership; (2) improvement of access and use of basic health services; (3) information management systems; (4) human resources; (5) health infrastructure and equipment; and (6) financing. For the past several years, the GOM&rsquo;s contribution to the health sector has generally ranged from 4 to 7 percent and, most recently in 2017, was set at 5.29 percent.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The primary purpose of USAID&rsquo;s work in Madagascar is to improve health outcomes among poor and underserved populations through improved healthy behaviors and increased access to quality health services.

USAID plays a key role in controlling transnational health threats such as drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB), which do not respect national boundaries and pose a threat to all countries, including the U.S. via travel. In the Kyrgyz Republic, DR-TB remains a significant challenge. Kyrgyzstan rank among the 30 countries with the highest burden of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB globally. Drug resistant TB poses a major barrier to achieving the USG Global TB Strategy, NAP, and the WHO End TB strategic goals and objectives. USAID supports the overall goal of the National TB Program to reduce TB incidence and TB mortality, and conduct activities to improve detection and appropriate treatment of DR-TB.

Sleep and stress can affect development, wellbeing, health, illness, and/or recovery over the lifecourse, and these relationships are multidirectional. Though the separate effects of stress and sleep on health outcomes is well-documented, we have comparatively little information on how these two phenomena interact to influence health and wellbeing. We need research that characterizes the interactions between sleep and stress more precisely. Such an understanding, coupled with reliable sleep-stress pathological biomarkers, could allow stratification or prediction of behavioral risks to health and safety, for example. We also strongly encourage investigations into how sleep-stress interactions are influenced by sex/gender, ethnicity/race, environments, socioeconomic status, age groups, marital status, and wellness/disease contexts, among other examples.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>About OppNet</strong></p>    <p>OppNet is a trans-NIH initiative that funds activities that build the collective body of knowledge on the nature of behaviors and social systems and deepen our understanding of basic sociobehavioral mechanisms and processes.

There are many reciprocal interactions between alcohol and sleep; chronic heavy alcohol use engenders sleep disruptions which may persist for months or even years of abstinence, suggesting enduring effects on circadian and/or homeostatic sleep physiology. Acute and chronic stress exposure contribute to sleep problems. The relationship between stress and alcohol use is more complex. While acute alcohol is anxiolytic and creates the appearance of alleviating responses to stress, chronic alcohol use exacerbates stress responses especially during abstinence. The interaction between stress and alcohol consumption has been investigated leading to the identification of alterations in specific circuits, neurotransmitter systems and ion channels. How alcohol use regulates interactions between sleep and stress have not been investigated. This is highly important as stress and sleep problems largely coexist and alcohol use could negatively influence both. Therefore, NIAAA interest in this FOA includes, but not limited to, the following research objectives:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Determination of the long-term effects of stress on sleep quality and how alcohol use impacts these effects.</li>    <li>Understanding the mechanisms of alcohol-mediated sleep disorders and how stress impacts the effects of alcohol.</li>    <li>Elucidating stress mechanisms for persistent sleep problems in abstinence from alcohol use and as additional risk factor for relapse.</li>    <li>Identifying factors, including genetic variability and epigenetic modifications that may predispose to anxiety/stress and sleep problems and how alcohol use might influence these genetic factors.</li>    <li>Investigating these interactions across the lifespan, especially during adolescence and aging population where stress and sleep problems could be significantly influenced by alcohol use.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><strong>NIAMS interests</strong></p>    <p>The NIAMS seeks applications that propose to build research teams to investigate basic psychosocial processes in sleep and stress within arthritis, musculoskeletal, and skin disorder contexts.

It is expected that BRAIN Initiative awardees will cooperate and coordinate their activities after awards are made by participating in Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) meetings and in other activities.</p>    <p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>    <p>This FOA is related to the recommendations in sections II.2, II.3, and II.4 from the BRAIN 2025 Report. These three recommendations call for accelerated development of new large-scale recording technologies and tools for neural circuit manipulation. These new technologies and approaches will provide unprecedented opportunities for exploring how the nervous system encodes, processes, utilizes, stores, and retrieves vast quantities of information. A better understanding of this dynamic neural activity will enable researchers to seek new ways to diagnose, treat, and prevent brain disorders.</p>    <p>Achieving these goals requires the ability to record simultaneously from thousands or tens-of- thousands of neurons contributing to the dynamic activity in a neural circuit. The relevant activity may be in clusters of cells packed closely together or may be in widely distributed circuits. Current microelectrode and imaging technologies are limited in the number of cells from which activity can be isolated and sampled simultaneously, by the size or location of the area to be sampled, by the depth of penetration, and by the invasiveness of the technique that might prohibit their use in human experimentation. Non-invasive technologies suitable for use in humans are currently limited in spatial resolution and temporal dynamics, as well as in their reflection of on-going electrical activity in circuit elements. This FOA seeks entirely new ideas, concepts and/or approaches from physics and engineering, and biology, for how these limitations might be overcome to enable increased recording capabilities on the scale of one or more orders of magnitude beyond that of current technology.</p>    <p>This FOA also seeks novel ideas for technology capable of manipulating activity in circuits that overcome the limitations of current invasive and non-invasive approaches. Dissecting the function of neural circuits requires the ability to manipulate neural activity in order to investigate underlying mechanisms and demonstrate causality. Current technologies such as microstimulation and optogenetic approaches are limited in specificity, temporal dynamics, and by the invasiveness of the technique.</p>    <p>Applications are expected to propose the development of ideas in the earliest stages for entirely new approaches for large-scale neural recording and/or manipulation of neural activity. Such ideas could encompass unique and innovative combinations of existing technology that create a synergistic result. An important goal is to stimulate new thinking and concepts for accelerating development of novel technologies that break current barriers to neural recording and/or manipulation. In addition to experimental approaches, this FOA may support early-stage testing using calculations, simulations, computational models, or other mathematical techniques for demonstrating that the signal sources and/or measurement technologies are theoretically capable of meeting the demands of large-scale recording or manipulation of circuit activity in humans or animal models. The support might also be used for building and testing phantoms, prototypes, in-vitro or other bench-top models in order to validate underlying theoretical assumptions in preparation for future FOAs aimed at proof-of concept testing in animal models.</p>    <p>Applications are expected to propose research that will explore ideas in their earliest stages of development in order to be responsive to goals and objectives of this FOA. The following topics are non-responsive applications i: i) further development of existing technology; ii) hypothesis-testing; iii) validation and/or refinement of current technology; or iv) development of analytical methods to be applied to existing technology and/or data.</p>    <p>The technologies that would ultimately evolve from these new approaches should be compatible with experiments in humans and/or behaving animals, and should dramatically increase the capacity for recording and manipulating neural activity in order to enable experiments that are currently not possible.</p>    <p>Applications from individuals not usually associated with neuroscience research or teams that cross boundaries forming interdisciplinary collaborations capable of bringing new and untested ideas are particularly encouraged. Accordingly, applicants might consider, where appropriate, multi-PD/PI applications that integrate appropriate expertise, including but not limited to biological, chemical and physical sciences, engineering, computational modeling and statistics.</p>"13173,Grant,"Demonstrate and Assess New Models to Increase Accessibility, Availability, and Demand of High Quality, Comprehensive Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Prevention, Care and Treatment Services     <p><strong> BACKGROUND</strong></p>    <p>India is at a critical junction of controlling its HIV/AIDS epidemic. Strengthening programs, based on understanding the epidemiological data and the epidemic drivers and the latest advances in prevention, care and treatment, is critical for India to stay ahead of the epidemic to achieve an AIDS-free generation by 2030. To chart a new course forward, the GOI conducted a mid-term appraisal of the National AIDS Control Program Phase IV and launched the National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS and STI, 2017-2024. Both documents call for &ldquo;focused and reinvigorated efforts to address the critical bottlenecks and ensure rapid implementation of the last mile strategies&rdquo;, through major systemic, organizational and structural changes to effectively reach and provide services for KPs, while also reaching to a broader group, their partners, spouses and children to achieve HIV epidemic control by 2030.</p>    <p>India&rsquo;s epidemic is no longer declining at the same rate.4 While new HIV infections reduced by an overall 66% in 2000-2015, the annual rate of decline was slow, especially since 2011. In some states in the northern and central part of the country, where transmission of the virus is driven by a combination of injecting drug use and sexual transmission, the new infections are rising or stabilizing (Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab). It is in these rising or stabilizing States/Union Territories where programmatic efforts need to be focused to avert increasing new infections and reduce treatment expenditure.</p>    <p>India continues to face a concentrated epidemic, driven by KPs. While the national prevalence among adults (15-49 years) has decreased to 0.26%, KPs remain at increased risk of HIV infection. According to national estimates, 9.9% of people who inject drugs (PWID), 8% of transgender/Hijra (TG/H), 4.3% of men having sex with men (MSM) and 2.2% of female sex workers (FSW) live with HIV.1 National prevalence rates among KPs mask the many overlapping epidemics between states, regions and risk groups.</p>    <p>Key populations and their sexual partners&rsquo; behaviors and how they communicate are changing; with a greater use of mobile phones and Internet to seek out sexual partners through physical and virtual networks. Increased use of technology results in evolving hot-spots from traditional physical venues such as brothels, bars, truck stops to more virtual networks, leading to important challenges in reaching the &ldquo;non-venue&rdquo; based KPs.</p>    <p>The primary route of HIV transmission to children is from mother-to-child during pregnancy, labor, delivery or breastfeeding. Motherhood is common among female sex workers (FSWs) and many have at least one biological child; with low contraceptive use and high burden of unintended pregnancy, FSWs have poor reproductive outcomes and avoidable mother-to-child&nbsp;HIV transmission risk. PWID, MSM, and TG are also part of families and many have children in their households. Data from India reveals that approximately 55% of MSM and PWID are living with a spouse or children6 . Wives of MSM bear a high burden of HIV infection: disclosed MSM and their wives had an HIV prevalence of 46.9% and 27.5% respectively; even more concerning, undisclosed MSM had an HIV prevalence of 22.8% and their wives are at high risk of HIV infection and less likely to engage in care given they are not aware of their husband&rsquo;s status. For these reasons, ensuring that family-based index case testing is scaled up through a stigma free and sensitive approach for KPs, their partners, spouses, and children is a priority to ensure access to services and reaching UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets.</p>    <p>It is estimated that compared to the national prevalence rates, PWID are three times more at risk of HIV infection (27%) if they live in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand; while MSM are two times more at risk of HIV infection in Andhra Pradesh (10%), and FSW in Maharashtra are more than three times at risk of HIV infection (7.4%). These varied HIV prevalence rates among the different typologies of KPs and areas of residence call for tailored strategies and differentiated care models based on sound epidemiological data at district and site levels. One standard approach will not be effective to reach these diverse groups.</p>"13182,Grant,"Call for Proposals for Changing Dominant Narratives in Healthcare <div class=""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"">    <div class=""field-items"">    <div class=""field-item even"">    <p>The Open Society Public Health Program is pleased to invite letters of intent from organizations, informal groups, and networks in Macedonia and Romania to apply for funding to change dominant narratives about Roma that influence healthcare professionals&rsquo; attitudes and behavior towards Roma patients.</p>    <p>In order to improve health outcomes and quality of services available to Roma patients, the Public Health Program will grant support to projects that work to transform attitudes and break down anti-Roma stereotypes among healthcare workers by (1) designing and facilitating positive inter-group contact between patients and healthcare workers; (2) using artistic interventions aimed at challenging existing stereotypes, and improving the interaction between patients and healthcare workers; and (3) developing academic curricula aimed at incorporating the principles of narrative medicine, cultural humility, and structural competence into medical training.&nbsp;</p>    </div>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""field field-name-field-eligibility-criteria field-type-text-long field-label-above"">    <div class=""field-label"">Eligibility Criteria</div>    <div class=""field-items"">    <div class=""field-item even"">    <p>Projects should fulfill the following criteria in order to be eligible for funding:</p>    <ul>    <li>The project provides opportunities to Roma patients and healthcare providers to collaborate on raising awareness about human rights in patient care.</li>    <li>The project builds storytelling and narrative competence of Roma patients, medical students, and healthcare workers in order to improve the healthcare worker-patient relationship.</li>    <li>The project uses art for social change in order to create space for dialogue between patients and healthcare workers.</li>    </ul>    </div>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""field field-name-field-guidelines field-type-text-long field-label-above"">    <div class=""field-label"">Guidelines</div>    <div class=""field-items"">    <div class=""field-item even"">    <p>Applicants can apply for a maximum of $30,000 for a period of no more than 25 months.

(IDG). All Common Fund initiatives invite investigators to develop bold, innovative, and often risky approaches to address problems that may seem intractable or to seize new opportunities that offer the potential for rapid progress.</p>    <h4><strong>Background</strong></h4>    <p>The human genome has revealed a great deal about the human proteome, though significant portions remain understudied. Only a subset of expressed proteins demonstrates the requisite properties to serve as targets for the development of therapeutics. Many bona fide drug targets likely remain to be discovered in the ?Druggable Genome? (DG), which can be defined as a subset of the ~20,000 genes in the human genome encoding proteins that have the potential to bind drug-like molecules. The term ""drug-like"" refers to the physical, biochemical, and pharmacological attributes of small molecule compounds that are generally recognized to be required for efficacious clinical drugs in humans. While the number of proteins in the DG is upwards of 3,000, the existing clinical pharmacopeia is represented by only a few hundred targets, leaving a huge swath of biology that remains unexploited.<br />&nbsp;<br />The discovery of a disease association or the development of a useful tool reagent can accelerate research into a previous understudied protein, such as was the case for BRAF. Thus, while many interesting and critical biological processes and potential therapeutic avenues remain unexplored because an initial, catalyzing event has not yet occurred, the IDG Program will address this bottleneck by systematically querying these understudied proteins to find phenotypic associations and develop useful research tools.<br />&nbsp;<br />While at the informatics level, genome- and proteome-wide tools can collate information and query all proteins, technical feasibility necessitates a narrower focus of experimental efforts into protein families for which there are definable understudied members along with existing technologies that can be readily adapted at the scale necessary for wholesale elucidation of their function and generation of tools. During the Pilot Phase of the IDG, it was determined that the experimental focus of the IDG will be on the understudied members in the families of non-olfactory GPCRs, ion channels, and protein kinases, as these families contain adequate numbers of understudied members and are well-established druggable families with high potential to impact human health once disease associations are made. It is expected that experimental priorities among the proteins within these three families will change over the period of the project.<br />&nbsp;<br />The IDG Consortium is expected to transform research by revealing a number of new activities and potential drug targets amongst these understudied proteins. Moreover, it is anticipated that the IDG Consortium will enhance our understanding of on- and off-target effects by establishing functional relationships among understudied members of the commonly targeted gene families.<br />&nbsp;<br />Thus, the overall long-term goals of the IDG Program are two-fold:</p>    <ul>    <li>To advance research through the development, broad dissemination, and use of community scientific resources to study human proteins for which publicly available information or active research is lacking in order to catalyze the discovery of entirely novel biology, with a particular focus on understudied members of the protein kinase, ion channel, and non-olfactory GPCR families.</li>    <li>To demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of illuminating the roles of understudied proteins, permitting the expansion of such approaches to a broader array of protein families beyond the three families of proteins in the IDG Program.</li>    </ul>    <p>To accomplish these goals, awardees of this FOA will be working closely with the existing awardees in the IDG program. Awardees from all IDG FOAs will form the nucleus of the IDG Consortium that will pursue the overall goals of the program. Additional non-IDG-funded members could be included in the IDG Consortium in the future.<br />&nbsp;<br />The current IDG Consortium is made up of awardees from the following FOAs:</p>    <ul>    <li>The Knowledge Management Center (KMC;&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-16-024.html"">RFA-RM-16-024</a>) aggregates knowledge from a protein-centric viewpoint across the entire human proteome, with an emphasis on the understudied non-olfactory GPCRs, protein kinases, and ion channels that are the focus of the experimental initiative. The KMC also develops a knowledge portal (Pharos) that includes the aggregated data and metadata, a query interface, and deployed informatics tools along with community access to resources developed by the IDG Consortium (see below for further specifics). The main goal of Pharos is to provide access to aggregated data and IDG resources for the broad scientific community.</li>    <li>The Data and Resource Generation Centers (DRGCs;&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-16-026.html"">RFA-RM-16-026</a>) generate and validate new knowledge and/or tools relevant to the understudied members of the protein kinase, ion channel, and non-olfactory GPCR families with the intent of broadly and rapidly disseminating knowledge and tools to the research community. As one of the essential goals of this program, NIH intends that tools and reagents generated by the IDG Consortium will be broadly available and distributed at minimal cost, and without undue intellectual property constraints, so that they can be used as widely as possible, enabling further investigation of understudied proteins by the larger scientific community.</li>    <li>The Resource Dissemination and Outreach Center (RDOC;&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-16-025.html"">RFA-RM-16-025</a>) assists in the dissemination of data and tools and the overall coordination of the IDG Consortium. The IDG RDOC works with all IDG Consortium investigators to collect, curate, and disseminate information regarding critical tools and reagents being developed by the IDG Consortium through the IDG Portal.</li>    </ul>    <p>Contingent on the availability of future funds, the NIH intends to issue additional FOAs to assist in obtaining preliminary experimental data around select understudied proteins.</p>    <h4><strong>Objectives and Scope</strong></h4>    <p>The purpose of this specific FOA is to solicit applications to build a set of Cutting Edge Informatics Tools (CEITs) that will augment the capability of the KMC as well as the broader IDG Consortium in the following ways: (1) by developing and deploying tools to enhance the community?s ability to process, analyze, visualize IDG data, (2) to prioritize new data resources and methods to be incorporated into Pharos that will strengthen predictions about physiological and disease associations around the understudied proteins, and (3) by developing methods to prioritize understudied IDG proteins (non-olfactory GPCRs, protein kinases, and ion channels) for deeper study using experimental assays both within the IDG pipeline or by the larger community. Awardees are expected to work together across the different IDG initiatives to help accomplish the overall goals of the IDG and to disseminate resources developed by them to the broad scientific community.<br />&nbsp;<br />Details about the planned informatics and experimental activities of the IDG Consortium can be found&nbsp;<a href=""https://commonfund.nih.gov/idg"">https://commonfund.nih.gov/idg</a>. The datasets, tools and capabilities currently available in Pharos can be found&nbsp;<a href=""https://pharos.nih.gov/idg/index"">here</a>.<br />&nbsp;<br />This FOA solicits applications that would enhance existing tools/approaches and add value (for example, by incorporating data not covered currently by the KMC that facilitates generating associations with disease and physiology) to the capabilities available to the community. These new methods should be focused towards increasing the predictive strength of disease and physiological associations for future investigator-driven studies on understudied proteins. Multiple community workshops held during the pilot phase of the IDG program have concluded that understudied proteins become studied when (1) there are tools to study the protein (e.g., tools that modulate protein activity) and (2) there is biochemical, cellular, or animal model evidence of disease/physiological relevance. Specifically, this FOA solicits applications that would enhance the following capabilities within the IDG: (1) building predictive informatics tools that identify specific understudied proteins with suggestive links to disease, cellular function or phenotype?the expectation is that such connections would provide scientific incentives (preliminary data) for these understudied targets to be investigated by researchers in the biomedical community, (2) enhancing the scientific community's capabilities in visualizing complex datasets in Pharos (and other resources) that enable prioritizing understudied proteins for study in relevant disease and physiological cellular and animal models, and (3) generate preliminary experimental data validating the informatics tool.<br />&nbsp;<br />It is important to note that modeling and informatics activities within the IDG consortium are not necessarily meant for starting drug discovery and development projects; at this point most activities will be focused on finding the role of understudied proteins in physiology and disease, relevant pathways, or identifying ligands or other modulators for them. Proposed approaches may have broad protein family applicability, but at the least must be applicable to all members of at least one of the three protein families of relevance to the IDG program, namely, non-olfactory GPCRs, protein kinases, and ion channels. Methods proposed should keep in mind the domain of focus is understudied proteins. This will require, at the very least, creative approaches to both modeling and validation of such models.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Plans for Experimental Validation</strong>: Approaches that aim to build predictive models for prioritizing proteins for further experimental characterization in disease and physiological models within the IDG program should adopt standard algorithmic validation approaches using existing datasets. However, preliminary experimental validation of predictions is key to establishing the utility of a novel algorithm, thus enhancing its adoption in the community. Therefore, applicants proposing to build predictive models should also propose a set of experiments that would provide a validation of their predictions. Proposed experimental validation need not be comprehensive across all proteins, but must include a subset of understudied proteins in either the non-olfactory GPCRs, protein kinases, and ion channels. Validated predictions (or specific prioritizations that come out of baseline experimental validation) will be considered as a factor in prioritization and further study by the IDG Data and Resource Generating Centers (DRGCs) and will be provided to the broader community for their use. It is expected that the algorithms will be made available to the biomedical community in a timely manner as per the data, resource and software sharing plan in this RFA.<br />&nbsp;<br />The essential elements of a CEIT application must address one or both of the following:<br />&nbsp;<br />1.&nbsp;<strong>Build &amp; experimentally validate predictive model(s)</strong>&nbsp;that can be used both by the IDG Consortium and the wider biomedical community. Such predictive models should improve the community?s capabilities in associating understudied proteins to their biological, disease, or pharmaceutical relevance. The predictive models along with relevant existing data should be made available to the community via Pharos. The proposals would need to articulate and scientifically justify (a) the value of the proposed predictive model to encourage the community to study an understudied protein, (b) the approaches used to build these models along with a likelihood of success and, (c) alternative or backup options. Methods proposed may be valid for any family of proteins, but should be demonstrated to work on at least one of the IDG protein families. The following list, which is not intended to be comprehensive, describes examples of activities that the awardees to this RFA aim to support to achieve the overall goals of the IDG program:</p>    <ul>    <li>Propose scientifically justified datasets to add to Pharos (and make them available through Jupyter Notebooks or similar technologies) that would increase the value of Pharos to the community and enable improved disease and physiological associations for understudied proteins. It is expected that the data in Pharos would enable improved preliminary evidence for future investigator-driven studies.</li>    <li>Generate and leverage tools to identify proteins most associated with specific phenotypes (understood in a broad sense, causal or modulation, etc., in human or model organism) and prioritize them for study in experimental systems. Phenotypes should place IDG relevant understudied proteins into disease and/or physiologically relevant biochemical, signaling, and biological networks under tissue, healthy, disease, ethnic, or aged conditions.</li>    <li>Use novel tools to rank predictions of understudied proteins disease/physiology by integrating evidence from model organism data or, human genetic, structural, and biochemical data.&nbsp;</li>    <li>Enable statistically robust ways to utilize GWAS or sequencing (whole-genome or exome) data to (1) rank predictions for experimental study, (2) to support variant based queries in Pharos, or (3) effect of, for example, GPCR variants on tissue absorption/retention of small molecules.</li>    <li>Enable utilization of multiple functional genomics efforts underway in the scientific community for IDG prioritizations and characterizing understudied proteins.</li>    <li>Develop methods to effectively integrate existing large data resources generated by NIH and other community projects to enable the community to study understudied proteins of relevance to IDG.</li>    <li>Build effective (with appropriate validation and incorporating patient protection as necessary) understudied protein disease relevant predictive ranking models based on Electronic Health Records data. &nbsp;</li>    </ul>    <p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Build new visualizations</strong>&nbsp;that would enable the user to navigate the complex data available from Pharos, being generated by the IDG or other datasets not yet being effectively mined in Pharos. The visualizations should enable decision making and ranked prioritization of proteins for further study in relevant disease/physiological models. Visualizations developed can help with data integration or be used to identify gaps in knowledge that prevent making a disease/physiological association for a single or a list of proteins. The following list, which is not intended to be comprehensive, describes examples that applicants to this RFA might propose in order to achieve the overall goals of the IDG program:</p>    <ul>    <li>Creating suitable summaries and effective data summaries and visualizations that would enable prioritization of proteins to study within specific contexts (disease, pathways, cellular).</li>    <li>Generating specific visualizations to enhance the understanding of the role of a protein (family specific) within the context of its interacting partners in the cell or tissue of relevance.</li>    <li>Developing multi-omics correlation visualizations to integrate different data types and discover the most relevant players in a given pathway, function, and/or phenotype.</li>    <li>Developing exploratory visualizations that enable users to navigate evidence about single or groups of targets. Highlighting evidence from multiple/orthogonal experimental and predictive perspectives. Likely the visualization methods will need suitable tuning between a broad perspective and the ?rate at which? users can zoom into a specific narrow set of targets that fit specific criteria.</li>    <li>Exploring temporal cause and effect relationships between proteins, pathways, and tissue context that shed light on disease/physiological associations for an understudied protein.</li>    <li>Assessing strength of evidence for disease/physiological association for a protein of interest or identify gaps in knowledge in making strong associations.&nbsp;</li>    </ul>    <p><strong>Utilization of Existing Repositories</strong><br />Applications may propose interaction with NIH-funded existing research consortia that are focused on generating significant datasets of physiological and disease relevance to components of the NIH. A partial list of NIH-supported data repositories available for reuse can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nlm.nih.gov/NIHbmic/nih_data_sharing_repositories.html"">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/NIHbmic/nih_data_sharing_repositories.html</a>.

A current lack of empirical evidence limits our ability to identify strategies with the potential to &ldquo;drive&rdquo; this Action Area forward. In addition, although these drivers are strongly correlated with individual health outcomes, we lack compelling evidence of the causal directions and the magnitudes of effects on health, well-being, and equity.</p>    <p>We seek evidence on the extent to which Action Area 1 drivers&mdash;mindsets and expectations, sense of community, and civic engagement&mdash;can be changed through intervention at the individual or population levels to result in better health, well-being and equity outcomes.</p>    <p>An ideal study to provide such evidence would experimentally manipulate a driver, measure changes in that driver, and then measure resulting health impacts. However, we recognize that a variety of constraints could preclude such a design within the parameters of this funding opportunity. Thus, we have established two key aims for funding under this CFP:</p>    <ul>    <li>Aim 1: To test the effects of specific interventions on the Action Area 1 drivers, in order to determine the extent to which they can be changed; and</li>    <li>Aim 2: To establish evidence of causal relationships between Action Area 1 drivers and health outcomes.</li>    </ul>    <p>While projects that can achieve both aims are preferred, we also anticipate funding research that addresses either of the aims independently. In addition, we hope to support research that can assess the potential of drivers to &ldquo;move the needle&rdquo; on health, well-being, and equity outcomes for children and families by examining Action Area 1 drivers within the context of underlying and structural determinants of health.</p>    <p>Researchers are not limited to the specific terminology used here to define the drivers. We will consider projects that apply broad interpretations of what drivers could embody, and that propose novel ways to conceptualize or frame drivers within the Action Framework. Moreover, achieving a Culture of Health involves multiple factors working interactively in complex systems. It is therefore appropriate to think about Action Area 1 drivers not in isolation, but rather as part of these dynamic systems, in which synergy may exist among multiple drivers.</p>    <p><em>*See the full CFP for the descriptions of Action 1 drivers</em></p>    </article>    </div>    <div class=""proposal_info"">    <h2><strong>Eligibility and Selection Criteria</strong></h2>    <article class=""freeform"">    <p>Preference will be given to applicant organizations that are either institutes of higher education, public entities or nonprofit organizations that are tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, but other types of nonprofit and for-profit organizations are eligible to apply.

NIMHD and the participating Institutes have a specific interest in projects that will focus on health disparities pathways, explaining opioid health outcomes by examining the impact of different determinants (biological, behavioral, socio-cultural, environmental, physical environment, health system) at multiple levels (i.e., individual, interpersonal, community, societal) on health outcomes in health disparity populations (see the&nbsp;NIMHD Research Framework for examples of health determinants of interest).<a href=""https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html"">https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html</a>.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Background:</strong></p>    <p>The abuse of prescription and non-prescription opioids is one of the greatest public health threats in the US today. Ninety-one Americans die every day from an opioid overdose. Driven by this alarming rate of opioid abuse and misuse, drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the U.S. Nearly 2.5 million people in the US are suffering from opioid addiction related to prescription drugs for chronic pain. Opioid use disorders (OUD's) were most common among those who were uninsured or unemployed, were low-income individuals, or had behavioral health problems. Seventy-five to eighty-three percent of those reported starting with a prescription drug. Presently, death rates from opioid overdoses in rural areas exceed urban areas, contributing to 63% of all overdose deaths. Those states with the highest opioid prescriptions per capita also have the highest opioid overdose mortality. These staggering rates are overwhelming families, communities, first responders, and healthcare facilities nationwide, with consequences that could reverberate for generations. The complexity of the crisis necessitates a multidimensional and multi-sectoral research effort.</p>    <p>A major consequence of OUD is opioid-associated Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) and the considerable pressure on the foster care system generated by NAS.&nbsp; Although the immediate consequences of this crisis are well known, knowledge gaps exist on the long-term consequences of NAS on growth and development, behavioral outcomes, as well as the effect of involvement of dysfunctional parents in the care of opioid-dependent newborns or the alternative of foster care. OUD also increases risk of infectious diseases with co-use of illicit substances by injection especially hepatitis viruses and HIV.</p>    <p>The majority (80%) of persons with OUD had another substance use disorder (SUD). Among persons with OUD, 29% had major depressive episode(MDE), 32% had bipolar disorder, 13% had schizophrenia, 53% smoked cigarettes, 41% had alcohol use disorder (AUD), and 43% had 1 other drug use disorder.</p>    <p>Rates of opioid overdose deaths continued to increase for all racial/ethnic groups. Non-Hispanic Whites (hence, Whites) and American Indian/ Alaskan Natives (AI/AN) have experienced&nbsp;the largest rise in opioid-related fatalities. The American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities, historically vulnerable to substance use, have an overdose rate comparable to Whites. Overdose rates increased 63% for Black persons and 43% for Latinos from 1999 to 2015. By comparison, the rate of overdose deaths among White persons increased 240% from 1999 to 2015 and similar increases were noted for AI/AN populations. By 2014, Whites and AI/AN's were dying at double or triple the rates of African Americans and Latinos, respectively. Factors that may contribute to these disparities include preferential opioid prescribing to Whites in specific clinical settings, and possible differences in clinical pharmacogenomics. There may also be undefined social and cultural factors among Latinos and African Americans that contribute to these observed differences. In summary, multiple factors specific to these populations may contribute to racial differences in opioid sensitivity, clinical management and resistance to opioid misuse. Available data indicate that a disproportionate burden of opioid use overdose deaths is borne by persons living in rural areas of less privileged socioeconomic status. There are no data on patterns of opioid use among sexual gender minorities and limited data on Asians, Native Hawaiians, and U.S. Pacific Islanders.</p>    <p>Women of reproductive age (15-44 years) receive more prescription medications than men, which in turn resulted in increased risk of misuse. Presently, a woman reports to the emergency department every three minutes requesting pain medication. The face of the opioid epidemic is increasingly young, White, and female. Among diagnosed OUD in 2015, 0.9 million were men and 1.2 million women, with 3,300 women affected daily. Women who misuse opioids face gender-specific challenges, effectiveness of treatment and outcomes. Unlike men, women commonly report stigma as one of the top reasons they do not seek treatment for substance use disorders. Women seeking treatment report high rates of childhood victimization, histories of sexual abuse, and current danger (47%) from violent partner. In contrast to men, women also tend to enter treatment at a much later stage of addiction, with more serious health complications due to accelerated physiological damage. More research is needed to address the gender-specific challenges posed by the opioid misuse crisis.</p>    <p>Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is the use of medications, in combination with counseling and behavioral therapies, to provide a ""whole-patient"" approach to treat and prevent opioid overdose (OUD). MAT has proven effective in combating OUD. The three medications used most in MAT are Methadone, Buprenorphine, and Naltrexone. However, less than 40% of those with OUD have access to treatment. Barriers to access include clinician bias, a lack of resources, insurance restrictions, and a wide disparity in rural-urban supply of trained substance use treatment providers. Efforts to increase education on treatment, particularly in non-traditional treatment settings, would be beneficial to addressing the opioid crisis. Timely population-based data about persons with OUD are needed for improving access to MAT for subpopulations, including underserved racial/ethnic groups, to reduce opioid addiction.</p>    <p>Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs), being statewide databases that gather information from pharmacies on dispensed prescriptions of controlled substances, are associated with significant reductions in opioid prescribing. Prescribing practices for treating pain should be evidence-based, responsive to patients' needs, maintain a ""minimize harm"" guideline, and implemented carefully by trained professionals in a manner that involves reasonable oversight through pain management regulatory policies. Implementation of the CDC Guidelines on chronic opioid prescribing would include routine urine testing for prescribed medication and other substances, monitoring statewide database for other controlled substance prescriptions and a harm reduction strategy to reduce the morphine equivalent dose of opioids to 90 mg/day or less. More research is needed to understand the influence of these policies and practices across various regions in the U.S and how that influences OUD.</p>    <p>Prevention in the realm of OUD remains a work-in-progress and requires strategies to ameliorate the current crisis. Evidence-based interventions are needed on the opioid crisis in order to promote drug-free communities.</p>    <p>Current community-level interventions include public education, clinician-patient partnerships, and community-based medication disposal programs. Some States now require information about opioids in the health education and medical school curriculum. There is increasing Clinician-Patient Partnerships where patients reach explicit understanding about goals and expectations of treatment with their clinicians. Future evaluation of Community-Based Medication Disposal Programs for unused prescription opioids awaits. Further research investigations are needed to understand the role of economic upheaval, unemployment, inequality, and other systemic sources of despair in increasing the risk for addiction and decreasing the odds of recovery.</p>    <p>In the criminal justice setting, drug treatment courts have been effective in treating individuals with substance use disorders. These courts are specialized problem-solving courts that divert eligible drug-abusing offenders from the traditional court system into court supervised treatment.&nbsp; More research is needed to reduce drug use relapse through risk and need assessments, judicial interaction, monitoring and supervision, graduated sanctions and incentives, treatment, and rehabilitation services.</p>    <p><strong>Research Objectives&nbsp;<br /></strong><br />This initiative will support multidisciplinary exploratory/developmental research projects that examine the following: sociodemographic, cultural, economic, epidemiologic, and biological factors in opioid care specific to health disparity populations that increase the risk of OUD; the consequences of OUD; ways to improve resource availability among defined health disparity populations to reduce opioid treatment gap; and underlying mechanisms for the variation in the prevalence of OUD in health disparities populations. Research projects are encouraged to utilize rigorous innovative multi multidisciplinary approaches with integration of multiple factors that are known to cause opioid health disparities.</p>"13655,Grant,Preventing and Controlling Tobacco-related Cancers in Special Populations13682,Grant,"Development of Curricular or Training Activities in Skills Development     <p><a name=""_Toc258873267""></a>NIGMS is taking steps to&nbsp;<a href=""https://loop.nigms.nih.gov/2017/10/new-nigms-institutional-predoctoral-training-grant-funding-opportunity-announcement/"">catalyze the modernization of graduate education</a>&nbsp;to ensure that trainees receive adequate training early in graduate school to develop the skills required for the next generation of scientists.</p>    <p>NIH has provided support for the development of&nbsp;training activities to enhance data reproducibility, to broaden&nbsp;training to reflect the range of career options&nbsp;trainees pursue, and to enhance the development of skills required to be a biomedical scientist; however, there remains a compelling need for enhanced training for predoctoral students to develop fundamental skills.

Advances in genomics and more broadly in biomedical research have been greatly facilitated by significant and sustained DNA sequencing throughput increases and cost decreases. The goal now is to improve the quality and efficiency of DNA sequencing and enable direct RNA sequencing (e.g., longer read lengths, faster turn-around time, greater accuracy, and higher-throughput etc.) at reasonable costs with the anticipation that significant advances in any of these and related areas would make significant contributions to the mission of NHGRI and the field of genomics, including to many of NHGRI&rsquo;s other technology development goals.</p>    <div class=""heading3""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p class=""regulartext"">The ability to rapidly sequence large numbers of complete genomes and transcriptomes coupled with the free dissemination of sequence data have dramatically changed the nature of biological and biomedical research. DNA and direct RNA sequence in combination with other genomic data have the potential to lead to remarkable improvements in many facets of human life and society, including the understanding, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease; advances in agriculture, environmental science and remediation; and our understanding of evolution and ecological systems.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">The ability to sequence many genomes and transcriptomes has been made possible by the enormous reduction of the cost of sequencing in the past three decades, from tens of dollars per base in the 1980s to a small fraction of a cent per base today. Technology advances, and in particular the development of a new generation of sequencing systems, have enabled the launch of many projects that are producing stunning insights into biology and disease. Nevertheless, the cost to completely sequence very large numbers of nearly completely phased mammalian-size genomes remains very high, and we remain far from achieving the low costs and high quality needed to fully enable the use of comprehensive and extensive genomic and transcriptomic sequence information in individual health care.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">One of the major contributions by NHGRI has been in the genomic technology domain. Those efforts have been so transformative that it is hard to remember genomics without, for example, a reference human genome, inexpensive short-read sequencing, efficient bacterial artificial chromosome methods, microarrays, defined common human haplotypes, single molecule sequencing, and many other significant technical advances.

New methodologies and substantial advances beyond existing approaches are sought that would, if successful, significantly propel forward the field of genomics.&nbsp; Applicants may propose work on DNA or direct RNA sequencing, or both, in a single application.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">The FOA deliberately does not specify goals for cost, quality, throughput or read lengths since achievable endpoints are likely to improve over the life of the opportunity, and applicants are encouraged to optimize and balance these key attributes for the technology approach proposed. It is expected that applicants will develop scientific and practical definitions of optimal cost, quality and read lengths relative to enabling significant genomics opportunities. Priority will be given to applications that propose improvements of an order of magnitude (at the minimum), based on state of the art at the time the application is submitted. Such improvements may be achieved by focusing on one critical factor, or a combination of important ones.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">For DNA sequencing, novel methods that generate large numbers of long reads of high quality with a low cost are sought. New physical or chemical detection methods for sequencing are especially encouraged along with substantive (no less than an order of magnitude) improvement to current high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies. Those methods that yield novel sequence-based insights or that solve existing limitations in the field (e.g., de novo assembly of phased human genomes, direct determination of multiple and specific base modifications, complete and quantitative sequencing of all the DNA in a sample, essentially complete genomes of single cells, utilize very small quantities of starting material down to a single cell, long reads of at least 150Kb to a megabase or more, etc.) are of especially high interest.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">For RNA sequencing, the need is for quantitative and high-throughput direct sequencing of entire transcripts from the transcriptome. Applicants are expected to develop novel methods for quantitatively assessing the sequence of full length RNA molecules without a cDNA intermediate.&nbsp; Enabling new approaches to RNA analysis is a key goal of direct RNA sequencing (e.g., exhaustive sequencing of every RNA molecule in a sample or precise quantification across the entire very high dynamic range of RNA transcripts, direct determination of specific and multiple base modifications, determining RNA secondary structural elements while sequencing, cost-effective and statistically-robust single cell transcriptomics, etc.).</p>    <p>High-risk and high-reward proposed research may plan to develop complete systems or novel key components for nucleic acid sequencing. Very novel physical or chemical approaches to sequencing are solicited along with novel enzymatic methodologies. The technology developed can either develop an entirely new way of sequencing or significantly improve existing sequencing methodology.</p>"13705,Grant,"Accelerating the Availability, Adoption and Scale-up of Improved Tools to Identify Severe Disease <h3><strong>Context</strong></h3>    <p>In 2016 an estimated 5.6 million children died before their fifth birthday. Pneumonia (24%), diarrhoea (15%), and malaria (9%) remain the leading causes of death in children ages 1 &ndash; 59 months, and malnutrition is an underlying factor associated with nearly half of under-five deaths. Both pneumonia and malaria are febrile illnesses, and common causes of diarrhoea in children (e.g. rotavirus, Escherichia coli) can also include fever. While all are treatable, the effectiveness of key medicines is currently at risk: resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) is spreading in South-East Asia and antibiotic resistance is a growing global concern. Efforts to improve child survival and preserve essential medicines currently threatened by resistance require a more effective, integrated response to childhood fever.</p>    <p>Over three-quarters of children seeking care at facilities and in the community in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) present with fever. The recent scale-up of malaria rapid diagnostic tests, together with decreasing malaria incidence, have resulted in an increasing number of fevers being diagnosed as malaria-negative. Evidence suggests that many non-malarial fevers are not appropriately managed due in part to a lack of diagnostic tools, leading to: inappropriate treatment including overuse and wastage of both malaria medicines and antibiotics; increased spread of antibiotic resistance; and high costs related to the management of drug-resistant patients. Moreover, missed opportunities to effectively treat sick children can result in severe disease (including severe malaria), which is often overlooked and contributes directly to increased child mortality.</p>    <p>Hypoxaemia, or low oxygen saturation in the blood, is a key indicator of severe disease that requires onwards referral and treatment, including oxygen therapy. While screening for hypoxaemia with pulse oximetry is currently recommended at primary health care and is included in the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines, this is rarely implemented due in large part to a lack of tools adapted for use in these settings in LMICs.</p>    <p>Promising, new pulse oximeters have recently entered the market that are better adapted for primary care use in children in LMIC. Pilot implementation of these devices is now needed in early-adopter countries to lay the foundation for standard use in primary healthcare facilities and to prepare for their widespread scale-up. In addition, multimodal handheld devices which can detect hypoxaemia as well as other vital signs including respiratory rate, non-invasive haemoglobin and temperature are currently being developed and have the potential to improve integrated care at the frontline. If a sustainable market for these tools is established, they also have the ability to support wider connectivity with other health services.</p>"13719,Grant,"Development and Validation of Model Systems and/or Pharmacodynamic Markers to Facilitate Neurotherapeutic Discovery <h2><strong><label>Background</label></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>    <p>Optimization of novel therapeutics is usually dependent upon preclinical evaluation in animal models or ex vivo model systems.&nbsp; In addition, it is widely recognized that the ability to monitor the direct effects of potential therapeutic agents on the intended biological target using pharmacodynamic (PD) markers is essential for accurate interpretation of clinical data.&nbsp; Unfortunately, many drug discovery programs focused on neurological disease lack both PD markers and validated models of disease and are therefore unable to adequately inform or predict translational outcomes. This FOA is intended to support the development of validated and clinically relevant animal models, model systems, and/or PD markers focused on neurological disorders. &nbsp;These model systems and PD markers should translate to the clinical setting to the degree that they can inform the decision to advance a therapeutic candidate to clinical testing and can inform clinical study design.<br />&nbsp;<br /><u>Animal Models and Model Systems</u></p>    <p>Animal models and model systems should represent a significant advance over those that currently exist for a defined neurological disease.&nbsp; They can include genetic, chemical, and/or physiological manipulations in animals or ex vivo systems that recapitulate a significant component (clinical manifestations and underlying physiology) of the disease condition in humans. Animal models should be compatible with endpoints that are measurable and relevant to the disease process in both preclinical and clinical settings.<br />&nbsp;<br />Development&nbsp;of animal models or model systems that translate to a human disorder or disease requires rigorous internal and external validation.&nbsp; In order to demonstrate internal validation, it is important to evaluate and understand the precision, reliability, sensitivity, accuracy, and dynamic range characteristics of the endpoints used to assess the effect of therapeutic or physiological intervention in the animal model or model system.&nbsp; In addition, it is essential that the general experimental design procedures utilized in characterizing the model are conducted in a rigorous manner, utilizing randomization, blinding and the appropriate power analysis.<br /><br />It is also important to address external validation, showing that the animal model or model system can recapitulate aspects of the disease phenotype and etiology, where endpoints or biomarkers of disease are similar and measurable in both the model system and in human disease.&nbsp; One component of external validity&nbsp;is face validity-the similarity between the model and the clinical manifestation of the disease (as measured by overt clinical symptoms, patterns of activation using fMRI or EEG, functional or behavioral read-outs, disease progression, etc).&nbsp; Another component of external validity&nbsp;is construct validity--the similarity between the physiological or biological basis of the model and the actual human disorder (i.e., genetic, proteomic, metabolomic markers).&nbsp; Although components of both face and construct external validity are certainly desirable in an animal model or model system, predictive validity provides the most confidence in the ability of the animal model or model system to translate to human disease.&nbsp; Predictive validity refers to the probability that a clinically validated therapeutic agent (biologic or small molecule) will have the same effects in the animal model or model system as it will in the intended clinical population.&nbsp; By definition, the evaluation of predictive validity requires a validated molecular tool that has been shown to alter disease progression in humans.&nbsp; Since these tools do not necessarily exist for many neurological diseases, it is not always possible to obtain true evidence of predictive validity until the candidate therapeutic is actually tested in humans.&nbsp; Therefore, it may not always be possible to evaluate the predictive validity of a new animal model or model system.&nbsp; However, it is important to include evaluations of internal validity, and face, construct, and predictive validity (to the extent possible), to provide evidence that the proposed animal model or model system represents a significant advance over existing animal models or model systems.<br /><br /><u>Pharmcodynamic (PD) Markers</u></p>    <p>This FOA will also support the development of PD markers that indicate the biologic effect of therapeutics administered to treat neurological disease.&nbsp; PD markers typically represent a component of the molecular pathway mediating the biological effects of therapeutic target modulation. Some examples of PD markers include receptor occupancy, phosphorylation of proteins in the target signaling pathway, changes in substrate or product levels as a result of target enzyme modulation, gene transcription, physiological changes, etc.&nbsp; These PD markers are intended to: 1) represent endpoints that can be measured in both preclinical and clinical settings, and 2) represent a significant advance over PD measurements that may already exist for the therapeutic agent and targeted neurological disorder.<br />&nbsp;<br />Since PD markers should represent meaningful and quantitative indices of a therapeutic agent's effects in humans, evidence of robust internal and external validation must be demonstrated.&nbsp; Internal validation includes evaluation of the precision, reliability, sensitivity, accuracy and dynamic range characteristics of the PD measurement.&nbsp;&nbsp; External validation typically verifies that the PD marker represents a component of disease etiology and/or therapeutic target mechanism of action that can be demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical settings.&nbsp; For example, manipulation of the therapeutic target (i.e., knockdown, silencing, activation) should result in a quantitative change in the PD marker that is consistent with knowledge of the target pathway. In addition, manipulation of the target with a therapeutic agent that has been in clinical testing (if any are available) should have the same effects on the PD marker in preclinical and clinical settings.</p>    <p><label><strong>FOA Scope</strong></label>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p>The FOA will support applications&nbsp;to develop animal models of neurological disease that recapitulate aspects of the disease pathophysiology as well as its etiology, where endpoints or markers of disease are similar and measurable in the animal model and human disease (i.e., neurological deficits, patterns of activation using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG), measurable genetic markers, functional or behavioral read-out, disease progression, etc).&nbsp; The FOA will also support the development of non-genetic models (i.e., motor function, physiological manipulations such as artificial vessel obstruction or diet) that expose disease symptoms in animals and humans.&nbsp; In addition, it will support the development and validation of ex vivo testing systems that utilize existing human cell systems (i.e., induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (IPSC).&nbsp; Finally, the FOA supports the development and validation of PD markers (receptor occupancy, gene transcription, protein synthesis/secretion, etc.) that can be used to follow the biological effects of the therapeutic test agent in the context of a defined neurological disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Since this FOA does not support the development of animal models or model systems for the purpose of testing hypotheses about disease etiology, it is assumed that model development will be based upon widely accepted hypotheses or knowledge regarding disease etiology.</em><br /><br />The knowledge gained from these studies should lead to the development of ""next generation"" translational models of neurological disease and/or PD markers of target engagement for therapeutics designed to treat a defined neurological disease.&nbsp; Taken together, the new translational model systems and PD markers developed as a result of applications to this FOA should provide an improved &ldquo;translational toolkit&rdquo; that will better predict the efficacy and safety of new therapeutic entities, thereby facilitating future drug discovery and development in the field of neurological disorders and stroke.</p>    <p><strong>Out-of-scope activities include :</strong></p>    <ul>    <li>Development of animal and ex vivo cellular models for the purpose of understanding disease etiology</li>    <li>Cell line development;

The subsequent influenza pandemics of 1957, 1968, 1977, and 2009, though milder than the 1918 pandemic, demonstrated the potential of influenza viruses to cause excessive morbidity, mortality, and, more generally, severe disruptions of healthcare systems. Clearly, the threat of pandemic influenza is very real. Also, influenza viruses pose a significant threat to humankind, with seasonal influenza disease leading to an estimated 290,000 &ndash; 650,000 deaths each year.</p>    <p>While vaccination remains the best tool for prevention of disease, the current influenza vaccines significantly underperform compared to the effective and durable vaccines used against other vaccine-preventable diseases around the world. One key reason for this comparatively reduced effectiveness is the influenza virus&rsquo; propensity for generating mutations in its surface antigens &ndash; the very targets of today&rsquo;s vaccines. Furthermore, the predominant technologies for influenza vaccine production necessitate a protracted and inefficient manufacturing cycle and a huge supporting mechanism for biennial flu vaccine strain recommendations; by the time vaccines are ready for distribution &ndash; 6+ months after strain determination &ndash; the viruses circulating during next season may not match up well with those strains in vaccines leading to less than optimal vaccine effectiveness. Although other factors also contribute to poor vaccine effectiveness, the annual formulation changes, the cost of and limited access to current influenza vaccines(regardless of how well matched they are to circulating strains), and need for annual vaccinations are barriers to protecting against global seasonal influenza, particularly among those in low- and middle-income countries. Furthermore, at best they may only offer partial or minimal protection against emerging pandemic strains. Clearly, there is an unmet public health need for a transformative, game-changing universal influenza vaccine that will protect against all influenza strains for longer duration, alleviating the need for annual formulations and vaccinations and leading to a panacea for tackling pandemic and seasonal influenza disease threats</p>"13781,Grant,"Food Systems for Improved Nutrition Research <p>The UK Department for International Development (DFID) and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is seeking applications for its Food Systems for Improved Nutrition Research Program to address a broad set of robust and large-scale research priorities to guide program and policy efforts to improve food safety in sustainable, nutritious food systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).</p>    <p>The goal of this program is to deliver high-quality evidence on innovations, interventions and approaches to mitigate food-borne diseases (FBD) and biological hazards related to food systems at large scale in LMIC food systems.

The authors suggested that the problems and consequently the potential solutions were deeply embedded in the nature of clinical practice, the healthcare professions&rsquo; cultures and the culture of healthcare organisations. Similarly, the Francis inquiry identified the failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust as systemic with some of the underlying faults being about leadership, culture and clinical engagement, and about the systems of management of and regulation of the quality of care in the NHS.</p>    <p>The National Quality Board (NQB) in England provides coordinated leadership for quality on behalf of the national bodies: Department of Health, Public Health England, NHS England, Care Quality Commission, NHS Improvement, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. It highlights the priority for all organisations to implement plans to improve quality of care, particularly for organisations in special measures; including participating in the annual publication of findings from reviews of deaths, the annual publication of avoidable death rates, and actions they have taken to reduce deaths related to problems in healthcare.</p>    <p>In response to the Francis report, Sir Bruce Keogh reviewed 14 trusts (nine NHS foundation trusts and five NHS trusts) that had high mortality rates to identify organisational learning. The Keogh Review identified significant problems relating to quality and safety and/or leadership in all 14 trusts. In July 2013, 11 of the 14 were put into &lsquo;special measures&rsquo;. Special measures apply to all types of NHS trusts and foundation trusts in England that are judged to have serious<strong>&nbsp;</strong>failures in quality of care and where there are concerns that the existing management team cannot make the necessary improvements without support.</p>    <p>Since the Keogh review, the decision to put a trust into special measures is usually made following an &ldquo;inadequate&rdquo; rating in a Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection. The CQC&rsquo;s chief inspector of hospitals makes a recommendation that the trust should be placed in special measures. At this point, NHS Improvement (NHSI), as the successor to both Monitor and the NHS Trust Development Authority (NHS TDA), makes the final decision about whether an NHS foundation trust or NHS trust should enter the regime. NHSI may also place trusts into special measures on its own authority. Since the Keogh review a total of 34 trusts entering special measures for quality (SMQ); three trusts have recently returned to special measures (giving 37 episodes), 22 have exited, and at mid-January 2017, there were 15 trusts in the regime, including two ambulance trusts. The special measures regime includes appointing an Improvement Director, review of the trust&rsquo;s leadership capability, and a plan for improvement including options for diagnostic work on assessing medical engagement, buddying with other trusts, and commissioning external expertise. Progress towards this plan is made publically available by trusts, as described in the guide to special measures (NHSI, 2017).</p>    <p>The regulators for healthcare quality in the devolved administrations are the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority for Northern Ireland, Healthcare Inspectorate Wales, and the Healthcare Improvement Scotland and the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland.</p>    <p>A review of progress by all 14 Keogh trusts, including 11 in special measures was published in (NHSE, 2016). A more recent retrospective review of learning from trusts in the first four years involved interviews in 18 trusts and with four Improvement Directors, and describes organisational learning from the experience of special measures (NHSI, 2017). This includes the use of the Medical Engagement Scale (MES) to monitor and gather evidence for improvement in medical engagement. Both reviews emphasise the importance of context, as well as describing the differing complex organisational interventions employed, and the variation in recovery and sustaining improvement achieved.&nbsp;</p>"13981,Grant,"Improve Health, Prevent Chronic Diseases, and Reduce Health Disparities Among Racial and Ethnic Populations     <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>    <p>Chronic diseases are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, largely driven by preventable health behaviors. Health behaviors, such as tobacco use, poor nutrition and physical inactivity, are linked to chronic conditions, premature death, and disability. Chronic diseases and their outcomes disproportionately impact racial and ethnic populations including African Americans/Blacks, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islanders, American Indians, and Alaska Natives. Addressing chronic disease health disparities is complex. The risk is affected by not only health behaviors and access to health care but also by factors that include income, education, economic opportunity, and location of residence. In addition, the risk for chronic disease starts very early in life. Attention to improving the access to high quality nutrition, opportunities for physical activity, and providing a smoke free environment for young children are critical steps in reducing health disparities. Thus, any effort to improve this multi-faceted challenge requires a long term vision and investment.</p>    <p>This NOFO will provide communities the opportunity to improve health, prevent chronic diseases, and reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic populations with the highest risk, or burden, of chronic disease (i.e., hypertension, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and obesity). The tools to accomplish this are culturally tailored interventions to address preventable risk behaviors (tobacco use, poor nutrition and physical inactivity).</p>    <p>The approach for this program incorporates evidence-based strategies found in a variety of publications and expert recommendations. These include Best Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control Programs, Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2015), Surgeon General's Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding (2015), Community Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation for Built Environment Interventions to Increase Physical Activity (2017), and The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Promote Walking and Walkable Communities (2015).</p>"13982,Grant,"Enhancing Health Coordination and Leadership on Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Tuberculosis (GPN) <p><strong>General Information</strong></p>    <p>Document Type: Grants Notice<br />Opportunity Number: CDC-RFA-GH19-1913<br />Opportunity Title: Enhance the National Department of Health's coordination and leadership on HIV and TB programs in South Africa under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)<br />Opportunity Category: Discretionary<br />Funding Instrument Type: Cooperative Agreement<br />Category of Funding Activity: Health<br />Expected Number of Awards: 1<br />CFDA Number(s): 93.067 -- Global AIDS<br />Cost Sharing or Matching Requirement: Yes<br />Version: Forecast 1<br />Posted Date: May 11, 2018<br />Last Updated Date: May 11, 2018<br />Estimated Synopsis Post Date: Jul 31, 2018<br />Estimated Application Due Date: Sep 29, 2018 Electronically submitted applications must be submitted no later than 11:59 p.m., ET, on the listed application due date.<br />Estimated Award Date: Sep 30, 2019<br />Estimated Project Start Date: Sep 30, 2019<br />Fiscal Year: 2019<br />Award Ceiling: $90,000,000<br /><br /></p>"13984,Grant,"Strengthening Strategic Information, Program Implementation and Capacity Building In Order to Reduce Morbidity and Mortality (GPN) <p><strong>General Information</strong></p>    <p>Document Type: Grants Notice<br />Opportunity Number: CDC-RFA-GH19-1911<br />Opportunity Title: Strengthening strategic information, program implementation and capacity building in order to reduce morbidity and mortality in the Republic of South Africa under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)<br />Opportunity Category: Discretionary<br />Funding Instrument Type: Cooperative Agreement<br />Category of Funding Activity: Health<br />Expected Number of Awards: 1<br />CFDA Number(s): 93.067 -- Global AIDS<br />Cost Sharing or Matching Requirement: No<br />Version: Forecast 1<br />Posted Date: May 11, 2018<br />Last Updated Date: May 11, 2018<br />Estimated Synopsis Post Date: Jul 31, 2018<br />Estimated Application Due Date: Sep 29, 2018 Electronically submitted applications must be submitted no later than 11:59 p.m., ET, on the listed application due date.<br />Estimated Award Date: Sep 30, 2019<br />Estimated Project Start Date: Sep 30, 2019<br />Fiscal Year: 2019<br />Award Ceiling: $2,500,000<br /><br /></p>"14033,Grant,"Reduce the Impact of Human Immune Virus (HIV) on Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) <h1><strong>SUMMARY</strong></h1>    <p>USAID/Nigeria is seeking assistance for the OVC Social Services Activities (OSSA) Project, on behalf of the U.S. President&rsquo;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR serving distinct geographic focus regions under PEPFAR, namely Lagos State, and the Niger Delta covering Cross River, Rivers and Akwa Ibom States. The projects aim to reduce the impact of HIV on OVC by lowering their vulnerability and risk. This goal will be met by increasing the uptake of and retention of OVC and the households that care for them in high impact HIV services. OVC subpopulations to be targeted include children living in communities most impacted by HIV in Nigeria, with an emphasis on adolescent girls, who are particularly vulnerable to HIV. &nbsp;The projects will offer services for OVC to improve their health, safety, stability and education. The projects will also equip households, communities and government to care for OVC.</p>    <p>OSSA is aligned with the USAID Nigeria CDCS goal of reducing extreme poverty in a stable, more democratic Nigeria and supports the Nigerian Government&rsquo;s National Strategic Framework on HIV and AIDS (2017 &ndash; 2021).&nbsp; The program also contributes to achievement of PEPFAR and UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals, with a focus on scaling up coverage of life saving treatment, care and prevention services for OVC and their caregivers. OSSA will focus on PEPFAR priority local government areas for USAID, currently twenty-two in number, though subject to change as Country Operational Plan strategies change. It will complement existing services funded by the Federal Government of Nigeria, PEPFAR, and other development partners.</p>    <p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>    <p>UNAIDS estimates that approximately 3.5 million people in Nigeria are living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs) (UNAIDS, 2015).&nbsp; Of those, approximately half are women and 260,000 are children under the age of 15. Worldwide, Nigeria ranks second in HIV burden behind only South Africa (UNAIDS, 2014). In 2013, UNAIDS reported that new infections were estimated at 220,394 including 53,000 among children. Approximately 180,000 AIDS-related deaths occur in Nigeria each year, and according to UNAIDS, 1.8 million children under 18 years of age are orphans due to AIDS (UNAIDS, 2015).&nbsp; PEPFAR Nigeria&rsquo;s strategy is to fulfill the UNAIDS &ldquo;90-90-90 goal&rdquo; that aims end the AIDS epidemic by 2020 by ensuring that 90 % of all people living with HIV know their status, 90% of people diagnosed with a HIV infection receive treatment while 90 % of people on HIV treatment will have viral suppression. However, only 19.8 percent of HIV-infected individuals are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment and just 30 percent of HIV-positive pregnant women receive ART to prevent mother-to-child transmission (Global Fund, 2014).</p>    <p>A confluence of factors imperils Nigeria&rsquo;s most vulnerable children, jeopardizing their well-being in the immediate term, and cutting short the fulfillment of their potential in the long term. These include the socio-economic challenges of chronic poverty, violent civil conflicts, and unmanageable urbanization; the consequences to livelihoods of environmental degradation and climate change; governance issues precipitated by institutional weaknesses, uncoordinated systems and limited implementation of existing policies; sociocultural attitudes, beliefs and practices harmful to women and children; all of which are exacerbated by household health shocks and chronic illness, attributable to HIV/AIDS to a significant extent.</p>    <p>Although official sources vary, Nigeria&rsquo;s Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development estimates that there are 17.5 million children at risk due to adversity, and in danger of failing to fulfill their potential to live a safe and productive life. UNICEF reported 10 million Nigerian orphans, due to all causes (UNICEF, 2013). These children face enormous challenges to their health and development and it is estimated that 95 percent of Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) do not receive any type of medical, emotional, social, material, or school-related assistance (National Population Commission, Federal Republic of Nigeria, and ICF International 2013). Childhood malnutrition is one of the major causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in Nigeria. A 2015 study reported that more than a quarter of OVC studied showed symptoms of mild to moderate malnutrition. In addition, close to 70 percent experienced household food insecurity, putting them at risk for malnutrition (Tagurum et al. 2015). Child anthropometric results indicate that 39.4 percent of boys and 35.4&nbsp;percent of girls are stunted (low height-for-age) (World Bank General Household Survey, Panel 2015 &ndash; 16, Wave 3). Nigeria has the highest number of out-of-school children in the world and the Nigerian children who do attend school have learning outcomes that are among the worst globally.</p>    <p>Violence against children in Nigeria is high relative to global prevalence. According to the Violence Against Children Study (2014), before the age of 18, 60% of all children have experienced some form of violence (emotional or physical); half of all children experience physical violence; one in four girls and one in ten boys experience sexual violence; and one in six girls and one in five boys experience emotional violence from a parent, caregiver, or adult relative. Less than half of all respondents who had experienced violence had told someone about this prior to the study and even fewer respondents disclosed their experience with sexual violence before taking part in the study.</p>    <p>PEPFAR is the major provider of OVC services in Nigeria. Children and their households receive needs-based and age-appropriate interventions, delivered through several implementing partners working across the country, and their sub-grantees - community based organizations working locally. In September 2016, PEPFAR Nigeria (all agencies) had a collective caseload of 1,441,092 children, spread across 33 states. The OVC portfolio also provides technical assistance to direct service delivery partners, improving quality and the capacity of the Nigerian Government to assume service delivery obligations, for the sake of sustainability.</p>    <p>In 2015, the PEPFAR program began gradually reducing the footprint of OVC programs from 33 to 7 states and the number of OVC served from 1,441,092 in FY 16 to approximately 1,100,000 in FY18. This requires transitioning some OVC clients to the Government of Nigeria and other partners, strengthening household graduation strategies and ensuring the efficient aging out of support for qualifying adolescents. In 2017, PEPFAR decided to pivot programming further, by having USAID deliver OVC services only within states supported by the agency for scale-up of treatment (Lagos, Akwa Ibom, Cross River and Rivers states). This pivot better aligns PEPFAR&rsquo;s OVC activities with its testing, care and treatment programs, and focuses these cumulative efforts on achieving the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goal for Nigeria in selected high burden LGAs.</p>"14055,Grant,"Research on Community Interventions For People With Dementia <p><strong>Research Question(s)</strong></p>    <p><em>Which interventions within a community environment (physical and social) make it easier for people with dementia to maintain </em>quality<em> of life and remain living in their community for longer?</em></p>    <p>Effective design features for producing dementia friendly environments at both the housing and neighbourhood levels, can help enable a person with dementia to maintain quality of life, continue normal routines and activities, and potentially enable them to remain at home for longer, and delay the need for a move into residential accommodation.</p>    <p>The concept of the &ldquo;built&rdquo; or &ldquo;physical&rdquo; environment is a term used to include all buildings, spaces and products created or modified by people.

An estimated one in six of us is affected by mental illness each year in the UK and it costs the economy &pound;70-100 billion annually as a consequence of lost productivity, time off work, social benefits and healthcare. Mental health and illness stem from a multidimensional interplay of biological, psychological, social and environmental factors which influence risk and resilience to illness and response to treatment. A key priority identified in the&nbsp;MRC Strategy for Lifelong Mental Health Research<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is to &ldquo;accelerate research and development to provide much-needed and better pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical therapies (including, but not exclusive to, psychological, behavioural, cognitive and digital) and early, preventative interventions for mental illness.&rdquo;</p>    <p>Drug development in neurosciences and mental health has declined over the last decades, driven at least in part by a high failure rate in translation of preclinical efficacy findings. Late failures may be attributable to a lack of understanding of the causative biological mechanisms and inadequate validation of the biological target in human studies. There is a need to improve academic-industry connectivity and awareness, so that the outputs of discovery research include the requisites of the downstream development pipelines. Industry may in turn be able to reengage with neuroscience/mental health research areas if the risk of moving from phase 2 to costlier phase 3 trials could be reduced, for example through the provision of deeper, more robust mechanistic foundations, or evidence of meaningful levels of target engagement and/or the provision of tools required to show this.</p>    <p>A multidisciplinary approach is needed to enhance the understanding of targets in mental health; develop new discovery platforms, reagents and tools; develop innovative new treatment paradigms; and revisit, repurpose or redesign the existing pharmaceutical and psychological therapy options.</p>"14190,Grant,"Applied Research on Global Health <p>Applications are invited for Stage 1 research proposals to develop individual programmes.

These co-infections can result in unique challenges in treatment and prevention of disease, including increased drug toxicities and/or changes in efficacy of interventions.

About 50% of all cancer patients, particularly those with pancreas and lung cancers, suffer from cachexia and approximately 30% of cancer deaths are believed to be due to cachexia, in large part due to respiratory, renal and cardiac impairments.&nbsp;<a name=""_Hlk514245285""></a>Currently, there is no FDA approved treatment for cachexia that restores muscle strength and energy balance.&nbsp;Cancer cachexia does not respond to nutritional supplementation, and therapies targeting muscle degradation or promoting anabolic processes have either failed or provided weight gain without functional improvement, suggesting a fundamental metabolic shift in the patient has occurred.</p>    <p>The lack of mechanistic understanding of cachexia processes has thwarted efforts for evidence-based approaches to combat the condition. Furthermore, lack of sustained support for such research and the perception in the research and medical communities that cachexia is not a tractable problem have hampered investment in, and progress on, this debilitating condition. However, the prospect of a major advance in understanding cachexia appears attainable as mechanisms and regulation of protein degradation, lipolysis, nutrient metabolism, and energy balance are being elucidated and unbiased discovery approaches to find factors driving cachexia are now available. Importantly, several published reports have demonstrated a benefit of targeting cancer cachexia processes independent of inhibiting tumor growth. The ultimate goal of this research would be to stop the cachectic process before irreversible loss has occurred and restore muscle mass and energy balance.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Purpose</strong></div>    <p>The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to incentivize collaborative, multidisciplinary basic research that expands our mechanistic understanding of the patho-physiologic changes that occur in cancer cachexia.

These supplement applications must propose a collaboration between cancer researchers and researchers with documented expertise in cachexia research.

Pursuit of related NIA research applications that can successfully leverage the expertise, resources and findings of the pilot projects of the Roybal is strongly encouraged. Ideally, translation projects supported through the Roybal program will not only result in benefits to mid-life and older people but will also advance our fundamental understanding of basic scientific questions in the behavioral and social sciences of aging.</p>    <p>Centers are encouraged to make research resources available to the larger scientific community or to galvanize scientists at several academic institutions.

The Model describes the full range of behavioral intervention development from basic behavioral science through intervention development, efficacy testing, effectiveness testing, and implementation. It helps to describe where a behavioral intervention is in the developmental pipeline and specifies research activities appropriate for different Stages of behavioral intervention development. (""Behavioral"" is defined broadly here, including behavioral, psychological, interpersonal, social, or institutional processes and may be designed for use at the individual, family, dyad, group, community, or health systems level). The NIH Stage Model provides a common language to facilitate discussion of intervention development research by applicants, reviewers, and funders. An examination of the mechanisms of behavior change or the principles underlying an intervention is encouraged by the NIH Stage Model in every Stage of behavioral intervention development. Roybal Centers are expected to have expertise at all relevant Stages of the NIH Stage Model to facilitate a multi-directional approach to intervention development that is infused with both basic behavioral science with an eye toward real-world implementation.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Roybal Centers will support Pilot intervention research intended to lay the foundation for independent, larger scale projects.

It may include phenomena operating at any level of analysis (e.g., social, economic, institutional, contextual, interpersonal, behavioral, psychological, neurobiological and/or genetic).&nbsp; It is important to note that questions regarding principles or mechanism of behavior change are relevant at every Stage of the intervention development pipeline and may also be asked in any Stage of intervention development.</li>    <li><strong>Stage I</strong>&nbsp;research is where a principle-driven intervention and the intervention's associated materials are created, refined, adapted, and pilot tested for feasibility, acceptability and efficacy.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p class=""IndentListParagraph""><strong>Stage I in research contexts or in community contexts:</strong>&nbsp;Stage I studies may be conducted in research contexts (e.g., in an academic setting where the intervention is administered by an individual working for the researcher) or in community contexts (e.g., in a community setting, such as a home or assisted living facility, where the intervention is administered by an individual in the community), as appropriate</p>    <p class=""IndentListParagraph""><strong>Stage I for the development of associated materials:</strong>&nbsp;For interventions that need to be administered by individuals in the community, the development and testing of provider-friendly training materials, and community-friendly procedures for monitoring fidelity for interventionists/ providers in community settings is often necessary prior to progression to Stage III and later Stages. Thus, development of these materials is a critical component of Stage I.</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li><strong>Stage II</strong>&nbsp;research is designed to answer the question, ""Can this intervention work when administered under ideal conditions, and what is/are the mechanism(s)/ principles(s) of behavior change causing the effect(s)?"" Stage II (Traditional Efficacy Testing) research consists of tightly controlled experimental testing (<strong>maximal internal validity</strong>) of promising behavioral or social interventions in research settings, with research-based interventionists/providers. It is expected that Stage II studies will include rigorous methods for ensuring key elements of intervention fidelity.</li>    <li><strong>Stage III</strong>&nbsp;research is designed to answer the question, ""Can this intervention work when administered under highly controlled conditions in the real world?"" Stage III (Efficacy in the ""real-world"") research consists of the experimental testing of promising behavioral or social interventions in community settings, with community-based interventionists/providers, while maintaining&nbsp;<strong>as high a level of internal validity as possible</strong>&nbsp;under these circumstances. Stage III studies are expected to include rigorous methods for ensuring intervention fidelity and validated procedures for training, developed specifically for use with individuals in a home or community-based setting. Stage III studies are also encouraged to provide information about the mechanisms or principles of behavior change responsible for any observed effects. (Preliminary</li>    <li><strong>Stage IV</strong>&nbsp;research is designed to answer the question, ""Can this intervention work when administered under actual conditions in the real world?"" Stage IV (""Effectiveness"" and ""Pragmatic Trials"") involves effectiveness testing or pragmatic trials on behavioral interventions that have been shown to have efficacy in earlier Stages.&nbsp; Stage IV research attempts to have&nbsp;<strong>maximal external validity</strong>&nbsp;and is always conducted in community settings, with community-based providers or caregivers.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>Behavioral intervention development is rarely a linear process and there is often a need to take advantage of new knowledge from basic or clinical science and return to earlier Stages before proceeding to later Stages to determine the principles underlying the intervention, to improve the potency of an intervention, to streamline the intervention, to develop community-friendly training procedures for the intervention, to develop methods to maximize real-world fidelity, etc. Multiple Stage I studies (sometimes conducted in research settings, but other times conducted in community settings, depending upon the goals) are often are needed to lay the groundwork for Stage III and Stage IV studies that can serve as necessary steps toward ultimate implementation. Stage I studies are expected to be the most prevalent type of study within Roybal Centers. Stage II, III, and IV studies may be conducted when justifiable (e.g., prerequisite Stage I work has been completed), and when such research is equivalent in size to Stage I trials. For the purposes of this FOA, Stage I studies and small-scale Stage 0, II, III, and IV studies will be referred to as ""pilot"" studies. Small-scale Stage II research may be conducted to determine efficacy and mechanisms of behavior change under optimal conditions. Small-scale Stage III research may be conducted to determine real-world efficacy, under maximally controlled conditions. In cases where interventions are highly inexpensive and simple to administer with fidelity (e.g., simple default interventions or technology-based interventions, Stage IV research may be conducted to determine real-world effectiveness, under natural conditions.</p>    <p>For more information about the NIH Stage Model, please see:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dbsr/stage-model-behavioral-intervention-development"">https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dbsr/stage-model-behavioral-intervention-development</a>.&nbsp;</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Thematic Areas of Focus</strong></div>    <p>Each Roybal Center will have a core scientific theme, concentrating its resources and pilot investments on a focal set of principle-driven intervention approaches designed to promote the health and well-being of individuals as they age. In line with that scientific focus, Roybal Centers will support pilot behavioral intervention research studies at Stages 0 through IV. Centers should have appropriate expertise at all relevant Stages. All Roybal Centers are expected to have a research focus on the basic behavioral or social mechanisms or principles that can explain how and why an intervention works as hypothesized, unless there is a compelling justification for not doing so.</p>    <p>The following are meant to serve as examples of possible themes:</p>    <p>1.<strong>&nbsp;Behavioral economics approaches.</strong>&nbsp;Applicants may propose to create, modify and pilot test principle-based interventions based upon psychologically-informed behavioral economic (BE) principles to improve individual behavior or institutional processes that are linked to patient outcomes.</p>    <p>2.<strong>&nbsp;Physical Activity (PA) promotion</strong>. Applicants may propose to create, modify and pilot test principle-based interventions to reduce sedentary behavior and increase exercise.</p>    <p>3.&nbsp;<strong>""Transdiagnostic"" (TD) approaches for mid-life prevention.</strong>&nbsp;Centers could focus on the creation and adaptation of transdiagnostic interventions - those focused on mechanisms of change common to multiple health behaviors -&nbsp; into scalable multi-purpose principle-driven interventions designed to promote healthy aging and prevent chronic diseases of aging.&nbsp;</p>    <p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Pain coping and management</strong>. A Center could focus on developing potent and implementable principle-driven behavioral interventions to reduce and manage pain and to prevent opiate dependence in midlife or older age.&nbsp;</p>    <p>5.&nbsp;<strong>Enhance social Connections or reduce loneliness</strong>. A Center could conduct research aimed at developing principle-driven interventions to reduce social isolation, reduce loneliness, improve close relationships, or promote social engagement to improve health and well-being.</p>    <p>6.&nbsp;<strong>Sustain Behavior Change</strong>. A Roybal could capitalize upon basic principles of behavior to create, modify, and optimize scalable principle-driven interventions to increase adherence to behavioral regimens and long-term maintenance of behavior change.&nbsp;</p>    <p>7.&nbsp;<strong>Harness technology to promote healthy aging</strong>. A Center could focus on improving the scalability of existing intervention in multiple aspects of healthy behaviors, such as physical activity, nutrition, sleep hygiene, pain, and affect regulation.&nbsp;</p>    <p>8.&nbsp;<strong>Reversing or targeting risk mechanisms in midlife associated with early life adversity</strong>. Centers may focus on interventions targeting biobehavioral processes through which early adversity persists and constitutes a health risk for exposed individuals. Interventions may aim to reverse or compensate for that risk; or they may focus on tailoring behavioral interventions to psychological or biological phenotypes associated with adverse early exposures.&nbsp;</p>    <p>9.&nbsp;<strong>Improving healthcare delivery using machine learning (ML)</strong>. A Roybal could focus on using machine learning techniques to assist healthcare delivery workers (e.g., clinicians) to personalize healthcare delivery by making better personalized decisions about patient diagnoses and treatment options, while understanding the possible outcomes and insurance coverage. Deep machine learning algorithms could be used for early diagnosis to screen patients who may need additional care (e.g., cancer screening, addressing health disparities, etc.) and integrate into Electronic Health Records (EHR).&nbsp;</p>    <p>10.&nbsp;<strong>Music and/or other arts (e.g., sculpting, painting, dance, etc.)</strong>. Centers may propose to leverage basic research on music and/or other arts on stress, anxiety, subjective well-being, etc. and develop, modify and pilot test art-based principle-driven interventions to promote well-being and health.</p>    <p>11.&nbsp;<strong>Maintain and enhance mobility in individuals</strong>. A Roybal focused on improving mobility might conduct research on behavioral interventions to maintain and enhancing functioning in multiple domains. Such a Roybal might focus on interventions to improve cognitive functioning as well as physical stamina to promote independent living and prolong for as long as possible an individual's ability to walk and drive safely.</p>    <p>Note: The examples above are not an exhaustive list but are meant to serve as examples of areas of interest for this FOA.</p>"14339,Grant,"Institutionalizing Biorisk Management Best Practices, Securing Life Science Institutions and Dangerous Pathogens <p><strong>General Information</strong></p>    <p>Document Type: Grants Notice<br />Funding Opportunity Number: SFOP0005182<br />Funding Opportunity Title: Global Biosecurity Engagement Activities<br />Opportunity Category: Discretionary<br />Funding Instrument Type: Cooperative Agreement<br />Category of Funding Activity: Other (see text field entitled ""Explanation of Other Category of Funding Activity"" for clarification)<br />Category Explanation: National Security<br />Expected Number of Awards: 0<br />CFDA Number(s): 19.033 -- Global Threat Reduction<br />Cost Sharing or Matching Requirement: No<br />Version: Synopsis 1<br />Posted Date: Jun 12, 2018<br />Last Updated Date: Jun 12, 2018<br />Original Closing Date for Applications: Jun 13, 2018 <br />Current Closing Date for Applications: Jun 13, 2018 <br /><br /></p>"14341,Grant,"Study on Vaccines for Diarrhoeal Diseases or Lower Respiratory Tract Infections     <p><strong>Background</strong></p>    <p>Vaccines have contributed enormously towards the elimination of diseases, including the control of infectious diseases in low resource settings.

Participants in a 2017 NIH workshop identified several research areas in need of investment, including optimized genome editors, specifically targeted delivery systems, and more predictive animal models and studies. Although research in each of these fields has been very active, efforts have focused on the needs of individual studies and not on overall procedures for improving and testing the safety and efficacy of genome editing approaches.</p>    <p>To maximize the potential of genome editing technology to treat as many diseases as possible, the SGCE program has been developed to accelerate the translation of genome editing technology into clinical applications.

The SCGE program will involve collaborative research by a partnership of genome editing experts, delivery systems experts, animal model creators and assay developers to produce validated techniques and knowledge through exchange of expertise, information and research tools. Awardees from all five SCGE program components will form a consortium, governed by a steering committee of investigators and NIH staff that will develop consensus policies and procedures for consortium-wide activities such as data and resource sharing.

During the first two budget periods (April 2019 - April 2021), efforts of the Centers should be focused on establishing animal cohorts through animal breeding and characterization and establishing assays and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for testing. The pig Testing Center should have the capacity to test at least 250 animals per year from April 2021 to April 2024. The non-human primate Testing Center should provide for testing at least 100 animals per year from April 2021 to April 2024. Those numbers include wild-type and reporter animals together.&nbsp; Reporter animals will be deposited to the Testing Centers (in 2021 for reporter pigs, 2022 for reporter marmosets and 2023 for reporter rhesus), and it is expected that the Testing Centers will focus on expanding the reporter animal populations, and use them for testing, as they become available.</p>    <p>Each Testing Center will be expected to:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Receive, verify and cryopreserve large animal reporter strains developed under the related U24 FOA (<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-18-013.html"">RFA-RM-18-013</a>).</li>    <li>Breed and maintain cohorts of wild-type and reporter large animals (either pigs or non-human primates including rhesus macaques or marmosets) for a) in-house testing of delivery vehicles and new editing tools developed in accompanying components of the program and b) distribution to the wider biomedical community.</li>    <li>Establish assays and SOPs to evaluate on-target and off-target genome editing in target cells and tissues, including germline cells, in wild-type animals.</li>    <li>Evaluate the ability of delivery technologies developed by the SCGE Delivery Technologies component to deliver genome editing tools to target cells and tissues.

Milestones are goals that are quantifiable for measuring success and include annual or semi-annual quantitative criteria associated with them. Prior to funding an application, NIH program staff will contact the applicant to establish a final set of milestones based on the information and preliminary milestones provided in the application (see Section IV); milestones will include the: 1) ramp-up time to reach full productivity in a newly funded program; and 2) yearly throughput and turnaround time for analyzing delivery reagents and new editing tools after ramp-up. After review and approval by the NIH SCGE Working Group, the final set of approved milestones will be specified in the Notice of Grant Award.</p>    <p>Progress towards achieving the final set of milestones will be evaluated by NIH Program Staff and the NIH SCGE Working Group on an annual and/or semi-annual basis.&nbsp; If justified, future year milestones may be revised based on data and information obtained during the previous year. If, based on the progress report, the project does not meet the milestones, funding for the project may be discontinued.&nbsp; In addition to milestones, the decision regarding continued funding will also be based on the overall progress of the Testing Center in meeting program goals, program priorities, and the availability of funds.</p>    <p><strong>Data Sharing under this Initiative</strong></p>    <p>Data from the Somatic Cell Genome Editing program are expected to be managed by the SCGE DCC to increase the value of the significant public investment in the creation and operation of the whole Program.

New rapid HIV recency assays, such as the Asante (Sedia Biosciences, Portland, OR: http://www.sediabio.com/products/asante-rapid-hiv-1 -recency-assay), distinguish between recent (HIV seroconversion in the last 6 months, on average) and non-recent HIV infection and provide results within minutes. Individuals with recent infection may have a higher viral load and therefore be more infectious and likely to transmit HIV. Individuals with recent infection may also be in a network with active, ongoing transmission. Recency data will be linked to monitoring/surveillance type systems such as HIV case-based surveillance (CBS).

As the backbone and engine of the Haitian economy, women are the primary operators in markets nationwide. However, since the 2010 earthquake, the economic situation in Haiti has slowly deteriorated. In rural areas, the situation is even worse, with many families facing high food insecurity and economic collapse due to recent natural disasters and high food prices.</p>    <p>As one of the poorest nations in the world, Haiti is plagued by persistent poverty and lagging development. Haiti is classified as a low-income country with a gross domestic product (annual percentage growth) of 1.3 percent. More than half of Haiti&rsquo;s population lives below the poverty line of $1.25/day. Life expectancy at birth is 61 years1 compared to 74.4 years for the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region. Fifty (50%) of children attend school. Thirty- three percent (33%) of the Haitian population are less than fifteen years of age3 and eight percent of mothers are teenagers.</p>    <p>Health Context</p>    <p>Haiti&rsquo;s health indicators clearly reveal weaknesses in the country&rsquo;s health system. While the recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 2017 suggests that trends in mortality and morbidity are improving, poor health outcomes and low utilization of services persist. Nearly 40 percent of Haitians have no access to basic primary health care. The country also has the highest rate of tuberculosis (TB) in the Western Hemisphere, with an incidence of 230 cases per 100,000 people.</p>    <p>Childhood mortality (deaths between one and five per 1,000 live births in the last five years) declined from 31 in 2012 to 24 in 2017. However, no progress was observed in reducing neonatal mortality rates (deaths between birth and one month old per 1,000 live births), which rose from 31 in 2012 to 32 in 2017. Infant mortality (deaths between birth and one year old per 1,000 live births) remained flat from 2012 to 2017 at 59 per 1,000 live births. The lack of progress in reducing infant and neonatal mortality is driven in part by the fact that over 60 percent of births in Haiti still occur outside of health facilities without a skilled provider. Improvements were observed in the proportion of children who are wasted (weight-for-height) dropping from 5.1 percent in 2012 to 3.7 percent in 2017. Stunting had shown steady declines, however, the DHS revealed that nearly one in four children (22 percent) under five is chronically malnourished, reflecting a long-term pattern of under-nutrition in Haiti. The proportion of children who received all eight essential vaccines rose from 18.7 percent in 1994 to 45.2 percent in 2012, but then decreased to 41.4 percent in 2017. Relatedly, the proportion of children who received no vaccines dropped dramatically from 24.7 percent in 1994 to 6.9 percent in 2012, but then increased to 9.7 percent in 2017.</p>"14421,Grant,Call for Metrology of Ionisation Track Structure for Characterisation of Clinical Hadron Beams14426,Grant,"Support Innovative, Interdisciplinary Research in Basic, Neurological, Behavioral and Social, Integrated Biobehavioral, Applied, Clinical, Translational, and Implementation Science <p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Division of AIDS Research (DAR) encourages applications for Center Core Grants (P30) to support Developmental AIDS Research Centers (D-ARC). These D-ARCs are intended to provide infrastructural support that facilitates the development of high impact science in HIV/AIDS relevant to the NIMH mission. The D-ARC supports innovative, interdisciplinary research in several areas, including basic, neuro-HIV, behavioral and social, integrated biobehavioral, clinical, translational, and implementation science. The intent of D-ARC support is that the proposed Core activities will allow the D-ARC to compete successfully for a full NIMH AIDS Research Center (ARC) after their D-ARC award period.</p>    <p>In both behaviorally-focused and neuro-HIV Centers, the intent is to support research that addresses the most current research priorities in the field. The proposed Center priorities should align with the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.aids.gov/federal-resources/national-hiv-aids-strategy/overview/"">National HIV/AIDS Strategy</a>, and international research directions outlined in guidance from the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.oar.nih.gov/strategicplan/fy2015/"">Office of AIDS Research (OAR)</a>&nbsp;at the NIH. D-ARC awards permit the centralized coordination of affiliated research activities, foster the development of scientific innovations and new collaborations, encourage interdisciplinary research, and facilitate the dissemination of public health advances to implementing agencies, academia, affected communities, and policymakers. These Centers have the potential to support studies in a variety of areas including biological, biomedical, behavioral, neuroscience, mental health, prevention, clinical sciences, and implementation science research.</p>    <p>Potential research areas that may serve as organizing themes or key areas of interest for the overall research strategy of the Center include but are not limited to:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Identification of mutable multi-level risk and resilience factors that are associated with HIV infection, including individual, contextual, systemic, and structural factors which can facilitate or impede optimal access and use of effective HIV prevention and treatment.

First, Centers should demonstrate excellence and leadership in thematic areas that capitalize on the expertise of affiliated investigators. In this way, D-ARC affiliated scientists serve as thought leaders who can guide the field in new directions in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment research based on the accumulating evidence. Second, given infrastructural support, D-ARCs are expected to compete successfully for funding from NIH and other sources and, in doing so, address key scientific questions relevant to their thematic areas of interest.</p>    <p>Applicants are strongly encouraged to develop and maintain collaborations with industry, government, community, implementing agencies, and other scientific networks and institutions in order to optimize the impact of Center-supported scientific advances and activities. In all potential thematic areas, Center programs are expected to address the key disparities that are evident in HIV prevention and treatment. For example, progress through the HIV care continuum is quite variable &ndash; there are stark differences in subpopulations that do not progress to controlled viral load.&nbsp; To address continuing research to service gaps, informed by local needs, D-ARCs are encouraged to develop collaborations with entities funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Human Resource Services Administration (HRSA), other implementing agencies, and/or local (e.g., city, state) health departments.</p>    <p>In a related vein, D-ARCs have the potential to assemble the evidence base critical to health policy decision-making pertaining to resource allocation, strategic priorities, and best practices&nbsp;for improving health outcomes. Those D-ARCs with an intervention science emphasis are encouraged to advance the science of dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions that have the potential to lower HIV incidence and prevalence and improve health outcomes when delivered as part of full-scale programs. In these ways, D-ARCs are expected to serve as local, regional, national, and global resources for rigorous HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and implementation science.</p>"14429,Grant,Call for Measurement of Phantom and Tissue Mimicking Material for Quantitative MRI Medical Imaging14430,Grant,"Support Treatment For and Prevention of Substance Use Disorder in Rural Communities <p><strong>General Information</strong></p>    <p>Document Type: Grants Notice<br />Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-18-116<br />Funding Opportunity Title: Rural Communities Opioid Response Program - Planning<br />Opportunity Category: Discretionary<br />Funding Instrument Type: Cooperative Agreement<br />Category of Funding Activity: Health<br />Category Explanation: https://grants.hrsa.gov/2010/Web2External/Interface/FundingCycle/ExternalView.aspx?fCycleID=35ee358e-d42f-4c7a-ba6e-d71f228eb1a9<br />Expected Number of Awards: 75<br />CFDA Number(s): 93.912 -- Rural Health Care Services Outreach, Rural Health Network Development and Small Health Care Provider Quality Improvemen<br />Cost Sharing or Matching Requirement: No<br />Version: Synopsis 1<br />Posted Date: Jun 15, 2018<br />Last Updated Date: Jun 15, 2018<br />Original Closing Date for Applications: Jul 30, 2018 <br />Current Closing Date for Applications: Jul 30, 2018 <br />Archive Date: Sep 28, 2018<br />Estimated Total Program Funding: $15,000,000<br /><br /></p>"14434,Grant,Call for Measurements for Mitigating Adverse Health Effects from Atmospheric Particulate Pollutants14436,Grant,Call for Standardisation of Concentration Measurements of Extracellular Vesicles for Medical Diagnoses14437,Grant,Call for Measurements for Screening and Early Diagnosis of Lung Diseases from Exhaled Breath14438,Grant,Call for Radiotheraphy Coupled with Hyperthermia in Adapting the Biological Equivalent Dose Concept14447,Grant,Call for Metrology for Advanced Radiotheraphy Using Particle Beams with Ultra-High Pulse Dose Rates14524,Grant,"Supporting Collaborative Research and Innovations in Bioeconomy and Infectious Diseases <p><strong>Opportunity Background</strong></p>    <div>    <div>    <p class=""my-rteElement-lead"">The SNSF is for the second time participating in the call of the Southeast Asia &ndash; Europe Joint Funding Scheme.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div id=""ctl00_PlaceHolderMain_ctl13__ControlWrapper_RichHtmlField"" class=""ms-rtestate-field"">    <p>The objective of the Joint Funding Scheme (JFS) is to bring together Southeast Asian and European researchers and innovators to collaborate on topics of mutual interest.

This raises critical questions: Which of these should be implemented and in what combinations? How does this differ for different highly affected populations and settings? The randomized clinical trials (RCTs) needed to answer these questions for both the US and international epidemics and sub-epidemics require large sample sizes and substantial funding. Modeling and simulation offer a strategy for down-selecting prevention interventions and combination packages and optimizing those that go into RCTs.</p>    <p>Modeling and simulation have proven to be useful in the study of many infectious diseases, including HIV. The NIH funded MIDAS (Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study) program (<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-16-107.html"">PA-16-107</a>) has led to recommendations for pandemic flu preparedness and continues to guide ongoing flu research. These methods have also been used to simulate the community-level impact of combination HIV prevention strategies, considering all available information on sexual network characteristics, mixing within and between communities, coverage levels for different prevention modalities, and other variables. Social media data and geospatial mapping have also been used to identify HIV hotspots and to predict transmission trends.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives and Scope</strong></div>    <p>There are two major goals of this FOA. The first is to support research that utilizes multiple HIV data sources to develop and validate modeling and simulation tools that can be used to examine HIV transmission dynamics and estimate the impact of HIV prevention interventions and combination strategies. Once the modeling and simulation tools have been developed, the second goal is to develop a mechanism and platform for making these tools available to other investigators.</p>    <p>These objectives will be accomplished through milestone-driven Go/No-Go criterion incorporated into the design of the research projects. It is expected the modeling and simulation objectives can be achieved in a&nbsp;<em>three-year</em>&nbsp;project period. NIAID recognizes, however, that making the modeling and simulation tools available to other investigators, together with one or more data sets used to validate these tools, will require additional time and effort. and require a fourth year of funding.</p>    <p>To fulfil these goals, applicants are required to provide Go/No-Go decision criteria for the transition from the development of modeling and simulation tools to the development of a platform for making the tools available to other investigators. These criteria will be referenced in the Notice of Award and used to determine funding for the fourth year to complete the project and make resources available to other investigators. Achievement of the stated goals (""Go"" decision criteria) will enable a total of 4 years of support, while failure to achieve the stated goals (""No-Go"" decision criteria) will result in negotiation of a reduced budget for year 4.</p>    <p><strong>Specific Areas of Research Interest</strong></p>    <p>Examples of research projects that are responsive to this FOA include but are not limited to those that:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Propose to develop and validate methods that incorporate local and regional epidemiologic drivers and transmission dynamics of HIV to optimize local and regional prevention strategies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).</li>    <li>Propose to develop and validate methods to optimize combination strategies for future trials in high-priority populations and settings (e.g. MSM, transgender persons, adolescent girls and young women (AGYW), migrants, and sex workers).&nbsp; The prevention interventions selected should have demonstrated acceptability and be suitable for scale-up in the populations targeted. -</li>    <li>Use phylogenetic methods to examine patterns of HIV transmission on a population level, identify factors associated with HIV transmission, and assess the impact of targeted HIV prevention interventions, focusing on highly affected communities.</li>    <li>Use network research methods to examine patterns of HIV transmission in sexual networks, identify factors associated with high-risk nodes, and assess the impact of targeted HIV prevention strategies.</li>    <li>Use multiple, large data sources to develop and validate synthetic populations for major risk groups (MSM in North America or Europe, general populations in SSA, and others) to optimize regional prevention strategies.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><strong>Applications of the following types will be considered incomplete to this FOA and will not be reviewed (See Section IV.2):</strong></p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Applications that do not include Go/No-Go decision criteria</li>    <li>Applications that do not include a plan to make available to other investigators the modeling and simulation tools developed, and access to data sources used to validate them.<a name=""_Hlk508959787""></a></li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><strong>Steering Committee</strong></p>    <p>All funded investigators will be encouraged to participate with NIAID staff in a Steering Committee that will be established to promote scientific collaboration, exchange of scientific findings among the funded investigators, and coordination of data dissemination to the broader scientific community. &nbsp;</p>"14547,Grant,"Tribal Public Health Capacity-Building and Quality Improvement Umbrella Cooperative Agreement <p><strong>General Information</strong></p>    <p>Document Type: Grants Notice<br />Opportunity Number: CDC-RFA-OT18-18030101SUPP18<br />Opportunity Title: Tribal Public Health Capacity-Building and Quality Improvement Umbrella Cooperative Agreement<br />Opportunity Category: Discretionary<br />Funding Instrument Type: Cooperative Agreement<br />Category of Funding Activity: Health<br />Expected Number of Awards: 25<br />CFDA Number(s): 93.772 -- Tribal Public Health Capacity Building and Quality Improvement Umbrella Cooperative Agreement<br />Cost Sharing or Matching Requirement: No<br />Version: Forecast 1<br />Posted Date: Jun 20, 2018<br />Last Updated Date: Jun 20, 2018<br />Estimated Synopsis Post Date: Jul 02, 2018<br />Estimated Application Due Date: Aug 01, 2018 Electronically submitted applications must be submitted no later than 11:59 p.m., ET, on the listed application due date.<br />Estimated Award Date: Aug 31, 2018<br />Estimated Project Start Date: Aug 31, 2018<br />Fiscal Year: 2018<br />Archive Date: Aug 31, 2018<br />Estimated Total Program Funding: $1,400,000<br />Award Ceiling: $3,000,000</p>"14552,Grant,"Prevention of Drug Abuse Among Youth <p><strong>Opportunity Background</strong></p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Activities</strong></p>    <p>Grants may be awarded for activities in low- and middle- income countries which fall within the general sphere of prevention of drug use among youth and which:</p>    <p>1) Are focused on prevention on substance use.

The infrastructure support will facilitate research networks through meetings, conferences, small-scale pilots, short-term educational opportunities (such as intensive workshops, summer institutes, or visiting scholar programs), and dissemination to encourage growth and development of specified priority areas and build resources for advancing aging-relevant research in the field at large. Network applications are limited to the following areas: (1) AD/ADRD care and services research, and (2) the coordination of international studies conducting the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP).</p>    <p><strong>1. AD/ADRD Care and Services Research Network:</strong></p>    <p>The Network would expand upon recommendations put forth during the October 2017 National Research Summit on Care, Services, and Supports for Persons with Dementia and Their Caregivers. The Network would focus on research to improve health care services and delivery and well-being for persons with dementia (PWD) and their informal and formal caregivers, within health care systems and beyond. The Network would be comprised of a standing group that would regularly assist NIA in advancing our dementia care research agenda.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Informed by the 2017 National Research Summit, research areas and activities of interest (e.g., meetings) include but are not limited to:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Impact of health care systems and long-term supports and services (LTSS) on outcomes for persons with dementia and their care providers; this includes how outcomes differ for people living alone.</li>    <li>Disparities in quality and access to dementia care. Examples include the mechanisms and risk factors that explain disparities in service access and quality for persons with dementia and their caregivers, as well as and how institutional and social contexts influence disparities in service access and quality.</li>    <li>Effectiveness of models and programs of non-residential and residential care for PWD, including home modifications and Dementia Friendly Communities in the U.S. and outside the U.S.</li>    <li>Causes and consequences of labor market availability and shortage of skilled individuals in the caregiving workforce; this includes factors that lead to effective workforce development and reduce precarious employment.</li>    <li>Impact of dementia diagnosis on individuals, caregivers, and families, to include individual responses and/or social impacts.</li>    <li>Health, financial, and social outcomes of the caregiver following the cessation of their caregiving role.</li>    <li>Development of methods for measuring person-centered outcomes, to include outcomes that matter to PWD (persons with dementia) and caregivers, including self-report measures across the disease severity spectrum and across care settings.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><strong>2. AD/ADRD Data Harmonization:</strong></p>    <p>NIA supports a broad range of population studies to address questions related to the prevalence, predictors, outcomes and future trends in cognitive aging and AD/ADRD in the U.S. and internationally. NIA goals include providing the research community with comparable estimates of AD/ADRD and supporting epidemiological analysis of the etiology and impact of cognitive decline and AD/ADRD. To this end, the Network would support 1) harmonization of cognitive function and AD/ADRD protocols and different diagnostic algorithms across existing studies; 2) small-scale pilots on survey content or methodology; 3) coordination and enhancement of existing studies that implement harmonized dementia assessment protocols; 4) development of new studies that implement harmonized dementia protocols; 5) dissemination of data resources to the research community; and 6) development of a research agenda for cross-national comparative research.</p>    <p>NIA currently funds an R24 network for harmonizing the HRS family of studies involving 30+ countries across five continents that have designed surveys to be comparable with the HRS, many of which are not supported by NIH funding. To encourage harmonization and innovation, they actively participate in the current HRS Harmonization Network. For study descriptions of most of these, see ""Gateway to Global Aging"" at g2aging.org /surveys at a glance.</p>    <p>NIA now funds dementia assessment in the U.S. HRS plus six international HRS-family studies: ELSA (England), SHARE (Europe), LASI (India), MHAS (Mexico), HAALSI (Agincourt, South Africa) and CHARLS (China). The so-called Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol &ndash; HCAP &ndash; provides the research community with new and rich data to study the prevalence, predictors, outcomes and future trends in cognitive functioning and dementia by producing comparable national estimates of the prevalence of dementia and supporting joint epidemiological analysis of the etiology and impact of cognitive decline.</p>    <p>Given that NIA is now funding the HCAP studies there is a need to fund a Network to focus on harmonization across the seven (plus) studies conducting the HCAP protocol.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p>The National Institute on Aging, Division of Behavioral and Social Research (BSR) supports basic social and behavioral research and research training on the processes of aging at both the individual and societal level.

The goal is to produce resources that will serve the field at large. Applications must propose efforts to advance one of the above-listed high priority aging-relevant research areas in the behavioral and social sciences. Applications should prepare plans for new high impact activities that are not feasible with existing resources.&nbsp; For the purposes of this FOA, AD/ADRD-relevant research is that which addresses issues of importance to the well-being and health of either mid-life or older adults and can include data spanning the entire life course. Applicants need not have a prior history of conducting research in aging.</p>    <p>Network support includes all activities designed to bring together leading scientists across disciplines and institutions to develop an emerging priority area. This program is intended to be flexible and support the creation of innovative networks that will propose activities and bring unique resources necessary to advance a set of well-articulated research goals. The application should be designed to have a substantial impact on the progress and quality of behavioral and social research of relevance to aging by virtue of the proposed activities. Networks are intended to serve the broader community of behavioral and social researchers engaged in aging-relevant research in the designated scientific area and are consequently unlikely to be limited to a single institution. Applications should propose activities designed to advance a field to the point of no longer requiring network support to sustain growth. Applicants should articulate criteria for assessing this progress.</p>    <p>Examples of network support activities include, but are not limited to:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Meetings, both large and small, to develop novel research areas and interact on the development of infrastructure.</li>    <li>Small-scale pilots to obtain data, theoretical frameworks, empirical methods, or support the development of novel or high-risk approaches requiring interdisciplinary collaboration.</li>    <li>Dissemination and outreach activities to draw researchers from relevant disciplines into the field.</li>    <li>Educational activities such as intensive summer institutes, series of workshops and related network activities, advanced seminars on methodology, or short-term residential opportunities.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>The networking, education, and infrastructure-building activities required for these efforts are rarely covered under an individual grant, and often do not fit the timelines for typical support mechanisms. In many instances the researchers that can support a successful network in an emerging area span multiple disciplines and are rarely located at a single institution. Therefore, this FOA is designed to provide research resources that create opportunities to shape the direction of an emerging field by addressing the network and infrastructure development needs required.</p>    <p>A goal of Network projects is to disseminate network resources to the field at large. These resources can include (but are not limited to) meeting papers/summaries; scientific publications; web resources; tools or guides to support research or data enhancement; data sets ranging from public-access ""user-friendly"" research data to meta-data, macro data or other aggregations of data to support research; and harmonized versions of existing data or instruments.</p>    <p>Networks may propose to support small-scale pilot projects. Network funding for pilot projects should either advance broad network goals or support preliminary studies with potential to form the basis for independent research applications consistent with network goals. Projects proposing small-scale pilot programs must propose how pilot projects will be solicited and reviewed in the Approach section of the Research Plan.&nbsp;</p>    <p>NOTE: Applicants are strongly encouraged to limit the number of key personnel on Network applications, to avoid establishing conflicts of interest throughout the emerging field. Participation in network activities, including presentation at workshops, or serving as faculty on summer institutes, or receiving pilot funding, will not constitute formal collaboration from the perspective of NIH, with the exception of those key personnel listed on the application. Network activities are intended to advance the field at large. An important consideration in developing a network is the potential to grow the field substantially through recruitment of new investigators rather than sustaining only the original team.</p>    <p>For network activities that span multiple institutions, applicants are encouraged to propose how those activities will be coordinated across institutions, and how the proposed activities will effectively engage with other relevant activities at participating institutions. Projects must propose a plan for dissemination of network products to the field at large.</p>    <p>The NIA encourages potential applicants to contact Scientific/Research staff listed in Section VII to discuss potential network development programs prior to submission of an application. The NIA encourages network applicants to support activities that will foster diversity of the scientific workforce.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Responsiveness Criteria</strong></div>    <p>Responsive applications to this FOA must propose network activities (described above) in one of the two priority AD/ADRD-relevant areas identified in the Purpose section (i.e., AD/ADRD care and services research network and AD/ADRD data harmonization).

The continuation of CHTN will maintain these two types of Divisions.</p>    <p>Applicants are expected and encouraged to apply for that type of CHTN Division that matches their capabilities. However, applicants proposing to predominantly procure adult specimens can also contribute pediatric samples for networked requests.</p>    <p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong>&nbsp;It is expected that some institutions that have already been part of the CHTN program will apply again for CHTN membership. However, prior association with this program is NOT required. All institutions with appropriate capabilities are encouraged to apply for these awards. Irrespective of prior participation in the program, all applications submitted in response to this FOA will be considered ""new"" applications.</p>    <p><strong>Key Terms for this FOA:</strong></p>    <p><a name=""_Hlk517262506""></a><strong><em>Primary Institution:</em></strong>&nbsp;Institution application-submitting institution with which the Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) or multiple PDs/PIs (if that option is used) is/are affiliated.</p>    <p><strong><em>Remote/Satellite Sites:</em></strong>&nbsp;Other Institutions subcontracted by the Primary Institution to increase the procurement capability of the Division.</p>    <p><strong><em>Division:</em></strong>&nbsp;The Primary Institution together with its subcontracted remote sites.</p>    <p><strong><em>Biospecimen:</em></strong>&nbsp;Any individual portion or aliquot of tissue or biofluid distributed is considered a specimen, and include among others, fragments of fresh or fixed tissues, blocks, slides, recuts, etc.</p>    <p><strong><em>Geographical area:</em></strong>&nbsp;Group of states that are assigned to each adult Division. Investigators from a given area must first contact the corresponding Division for sample requests.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></div>    <p>The CHTN was established to address the increasing demand by the scientific community for access to high quality human tissue specimens (biospecimens) for cancer research. Often, researchers are unable to establish the necessary clinical collaborations for access to the biospecimens they need. This network of tissue collection laboratories was established to make high quality human specimens available to the general scientific community for basic and early translational cancer research, as well as assay development.</p>    <p>The CHTN currently consists of a network of six institutions, each of which is referred to as a CHTN ""Division."" The Network provides prospective investigator-defined procurement of pre-cancerous, cancerous, benign neoplastic, non-neoplastic samples, as well as uninvolved tissues and fluids to researchers throughout North America and elsewhere. Samples are de-identified but annotated with patient basic demographics including gender, age, and race. The pathology report is included. The Divisional PDs/PIs should be actively involved in the practice of anatomic pathology, provide quality control assessments of each sample, and be responsible for proper histopathological characterization.</p>    <p>The CHTN provides tissues for investigators using several methods of specimen preparation including snap frozen, fresh, formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) and/or stained and unstained slides. The CHTN also produces tissue microarrays (TMAs) representing multiple tissue types. The CHTN also provides macro-dissection and nucleic acid isolation services. The CHTN does not generally serve as a tissue bank, but it does store limited numbers of specialized tumor types, such as rare pediatric and adult tumors (gliomas, sarcomas, etc.), to ensure their availability in the future.</p>    <p>Currently, five Divisions of the CHTN provide specimens from adults and each is assigned a geographic area of the United States (U.S.) from which researchers' requests are received. A sixth Division, the Pediatric Division, receives requests for pediatric specimens from across the U.S. In order to serve investigators as rapidly as possible, biospecimen requests that cannot be filled within a few weeks by the assigned division are ""networked"" to all Divisions.</p>    <p>Systems have been developed to facilitate efficient communication among Divisions and to share investigators' requests and determine biospecimen availability. The CHTN Informatics System (IT) has two components:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li><strong><em>The Donor IT system</em></strong>, which is used mainly for the specimen procurement workflow, includes the data about the biospecimens that are collected at each individual Division. This information is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and is stored locally by the individual Divisions. Each Division uses their own individual Donor System.</li>    <li><strong><em>The Investigators' IT system</em></strong>&nbsp;is used for data about the investigator and his/her tissue requests. The data is not confidential and is stored in a centralized database system for this purpose. This component is shared by all CHTN Divisions.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>Since 1987, the CHTN has become a vital resource for the research community. The CHTN continues to have a significant scientific impact at several levels: more than 40,000 specimens are provided per year. Since its inception, the CHTN has distributed over 1,180,000 specimens. Currently, the CHTN serves over 400 individual researchers per year, supporting multiple requests and projects for many of them. The majority of CHTN users are grantees from academic institutions, with government funded grant, most of them R01 grants. About 20% of CHTN users are scientists affiliated with the biomedical industry.</p>    <p>The continuation of the Network is expected to facilitate basic cancer research discovery, early translation, as well as the development and application of new technologies to clinical specimens.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>OBJECTIVES and SCOPE</strong></div>    <p>This FOA requests applications for cooperative agreements for the CHTN either for ""Adult Biospecimen Division"" or ""Pediatric Biospecimen Division."" Regardless of which type of Division is proposed, all applicants responding to this FOA must have appropriate capabilities to serve the CHTN objectives outlined below.</p>    <p>The major focus of the entire Network is to collect and distribute high quality human biospecimens for basic ""discovery"" research, early translation research and molecular assay development.</p>    <p>The NCI anticipates that CHTN will comprise up to six CHTN Divisions, each supported by a separate UM1 award. CHTN awardees will be part of a network to prospectively collect and distribute high quality tissue specimens to investigators throughout North America and elsewhere. The Network will be expected to provide sufficiently large numbers of tumor specimens from a wide variety of cancers. The CHTN network should also have access to biospecimens of rare tumor types and provide researchers with such specimens as needed. Pre-cancerous, cancerous, benign neoplastic, non-neoplastic diseases as well as uninvolved tissues will be collected and prepared to meet researcher requests. Tissues and fluids will be procured. Biopecimens will be excess materials collected during the course of routine medical care or at autopsy.</p>    <p>Even though applicants proposing an Adult Biospecimen Division must be predominantly focused on procuring adult specimens, they may also contribute pediatric samples for networked requests, if they have (or expect having) access to such biospecimens</p>    <p><strong>Main Required Capabilities/Attributes</strong></p>    <p>All applicants must be able to meet specific requirements for the key capabilities and essential attributes of the infrastructure listed below.</p>    <p><strong>All the applicants must have the following capabilities in place (by the time of award start):</strong></p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>The leadership [including the designated Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI)] with appropriate qualifications and current expertise in biospecimen collection, as needed to ensure meeting the goals of the CHTN.</li>    <li>Appropriate arrangements with partnering institutions to ensure the availability of suitable biospecimens for patient diagnosis and quality control of research specimens. Each Division is expected to collect samples from their affiliated local Institution(s). However, applicant's affiliated Institutions are expected to engage collection of specimens from geographically wide areas beyond the state of the primary Institution. In addition of samples obtained at the primary Institution, applicants must foresee sub-contractual arrangements with remote site hospitals, at least some outside the primary institution's state, for sample procurement. These arrangements with appropriate satellite sites (hospitals) should contribute to the procurement of a wide range of samples (including the types indicated above) and help to achieve a representation of the entire US population in the sample collection.</li>    <li>Adequate infrastructure to collect and distribute specimens, including both frozen and FFPE. Given the current state of operations of the CHTN (over 40,000 samples distributed per year), it is expected that each Division will provide its fair share of the total (at least 6,000 samples/year/Division or more.)</li>    <li>Ability to collect matched blood/tumor or other matched normal tissue/tumor specimens.</li>    <li>Ability to procure a wide range of samples, including: a) various tumor types, such as common cancers (lung, breast, ovary, colon, prostate, etc.); b) less frequent tumors (central nervous system, soft tissue sarcomas, head and neck tumors, endocrine tumors, etc.); c) normal, pre-malignant, malignant or matched uninvolved tissue samples; d) matched blood/normal or tumor samples; e) fluids such as plasma, serum, sputum, urine, etc.; f) nucleic acid extractions; g) specific samples that are difficult to procure for research purposes, such as bone marrow (normal, diseased), melanoma, others.</li>    <li>The ability to fulfill highly customized requests such as: a) fresh tissues prepared in requestor-specified media, including standard and customized media, requestor-defined use (or no use) of antibiotics etc.; b) touch preparations (slides); c) fluids processed at -20 &deg;C, -80 &deg;C, ambient temperature, ice pack, liquid Nitrogen/Vapor Phase, etc.</li>    <li>Appropriate informatics technology (IT) systems. Each applicant institution has to have an operating IT system that handles and tracks the following local data: availability of biospecimens, donor consent, HIPAA authorization, donor code, site where biospecimen was collected, donor demographics, biospecimen diagnosis (organ, diagnosis, modifiers of diagnosis), other biospecimen information such as amount, processing (e.g. paraffin block, frozen, etc), pathology report information, biospecimen quality control information, collection and processing times, storage sites for each biospecimen; investigators' information such as affiliation (academic institution, industry, government, other), funding mechanism (grant, other), etc.</li>    <li>Reliable Quality Management System for collecting, processing, storing, and shipping tissue and fluid biospecimens. All collection sites/Laboratories should be College of American Pathology (CAP) accredited. CAP accreditation for the biorepository/biobank is not mandatory.</li>    <li>Knowledge of and procedures regarding human subjects policy issues, in general, and in the applicant Institution related to the use of human biospecimens for research purposes, including assurances of appropriate informed consent as necessary.</li>    <li>Although the Network is not intended generally to function as a tumor bank, each proposed Division should have an ability to store biospecimens pending the completion of shipments. Likewise, it may need to bank rare tumors that would not otherwise be available (e.g., gliomas, sarcomas, pediatric tumors, etc.). Biospecimens corresponding to pre-malignant lesions, when available, can also be stored for future distribution. Most data routinely provided with the biospecimens is limited to histopathologic and demographic information, such as that related to diagnosis, sex, age, race, and pathology report.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>Individual CHTN Division awardees must be able to meet the requirements of the Federal Human Subjects Regulations 45CFR46 (i.e., the Common Rule;&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html"">http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html</a>&nbsp;). Federal requirements to protect human subjects apply to a broader range of research, including research that uses biospecimens, residual diagnostic biospecimens, and medical information (<a href=""https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/biological-materials-and-data/index.html"">https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/biological-materials-and-data/index.html</a>).</p>    <p><strong>In addition to the required aspects, the following (optional but encouraged) capabilities may be viewed as advantageous in terms of programmatic priorities:</strong></p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>It is expected that most biospecimens will be accompanied by basic annotations such as those included in the Pathology Report (age, gender, histological diagnosis). However, applicants are encouraged to develop capabilities for the collection of expanded sets of clinical data and do such collection, whenever feasible. An established broad Consent for all patients at the Institution for research to be conducted in remnant specimens facilitates this process.</li>    <li>The availability (at the applicants' institution) of collections of retrospective material, both FFPE and frozen, that can supplement/complement requests in the future, and therefore, expedite them, especially for rare or difficult to obtain samples (examples: gliomas, sarcomas, pediatric tumors, bone marrow, etc.); and</li>    <li>Expertise and technical capabilities to provide additional processing of biospecimens (e.g., DNA/RNA preparations, tissue microarrays, or macrodissections) that may be of importance to investigators seeking to use the resource.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><strong>Trans-Network Interactions</strong></p>    <p>Given the diverse and variable needs of basic discovery and early translational research, it is expected that the proportion of highly customized and/or non-standard requests for biospecimen collection will increase. To meet these needs, it is essential to maximize the efficiency and capabilities of the entire CHTN operating as a network.</p>    <p>Although separate awards will be made for each CHTN Division, awardees will be required to work collaboratively with other CHTN Divisions. Requests for biospecimens will be networked by Divisions so that they can be fulfilled more rapidly.</p>    <p>Members of the Network (i.e., CHTN Divisions) will be expected to collaboratively establish and implement appropriate procedures to collect, process, and handle biospecimens to assure that they are of high quality and suitable for a wide variety of studies and technologies.</p>    <p>Individual Divisions will be expected to provide some additional services matching their unique capabilities (for example, special types of biospecimen processing, which may include DNA/RNA preparations, tissue microarrays, or macrodissections).</p>    <p><em>IT Coordinator.&nbsp;</em>Although each Division may have their own Informatics module system for biospecimen collection, all Divisions need to use a common Informatics system for tracking the CHTN applications, requests, and distribution of specimens, as well as reports to NCI. Therefore, the CHTN program will support a dedicated, trans-network IT Coordinator. This IT Coordinator will be based at one of the CHTN Divisions but will be responsible for trans-network IT needs and priorities as determined by CHTN Coordinating Committee.</p>"14583,Grant,"Initiative for Health and Basic Education <p><strong>Proposal guidelines</strong><br />These guidelines were designed to help fund seeking organisations to submit their proposals.

Background</strong></p>    <p>There is an urgent need to improve care for persons with dementia (PWD) and their caregivers within the context of health and long-term care systems. Lack of continuity of care is associated with higher rates of hospitalization, emergency department visits, unnecessary testing, and health care spending. Late diagnoses of dementia and lack of coordination among providers and care settings can lead to inappropriate care, premature institutionalization, and burdensome transitions in late-stage dementia. Poor-quality and inappropriate care can mean a worse quality of life for PWD and their caregivers. Changes in the content and organization of care might improve the quality of life for PWD, relieve the burden for caregivers, improve care transitions, and enhance care overall. Small studies have provided some evidence that improvements are possible. However, there is a need for studies in real-world settings and at scales adequate to provide evidence for benefit across multiple health care settings and across different health systems.</p>    <p>The aim of this FOA is to support a center for collaborative research within and among health and long-term care systems to encourage pragmatic trials of innovative dementia care. Specifically, for this FOA, health and long-term care systems are defined broadly and include organizations providing care across settings to include primary and specialty outpatient care; acute inpatient care; skilled nursing and other rehabilitation facilities; residential long-term care; and home and community-based services. Organizations may be traditional health care systems (e.g., HMOs), primary care clinics, health insurance companies, managed care plans, home health care providers, memory clinics, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, outpatient clinics, federally designated health centers, hospitals, and other providers of acute and long-term care.</p>    <p class=""heading4Indent""><strong>2. Specific Objectives of the Collaboratory</strong></p>    <p>The specific objectives of the Collaboratory are: 1) serve as a national resource to promote development of pragmatic trials and demonstration projects to improve care and health outcomes for PWD and their caregivers; 2) support pilot pragmatic trials within the Collaboratory; 3) develop and disseminate technical and policy guidelines and best practices for effectively conducting AD/ADRD research studies in partnership with health care systems; 4) work collaboratively with researchers to provide technical support for scaling up pilot studies; and 5) disseminate best practices for engaging stakeholders in research, conducting ethical research in the special circumstances of dementia care, and involving long-term and acute-care providers.</p>    <p>The Collaboratory will build investigator capacity, support Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) pragmatic trial design, and maintain the resource and knowledge base for AD/ADRD pragmatic trials through the following features:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Administrative coordination;</li>    <li>Data, Electronic Health Records (EHRs), and health care systems interactions;</li>    <li>Collection and use of Clinical Outcome Assessments (COAs), including patient-reported outcomes (PROs), caregiver-reported outcomes (CRO), observer-reported outcomes (ObsROs), performance outcomes (PerfOs), and clinician-reported outcomes (ClinROs);</li>    <li>Robust stakeholder engagement in Collaboratory governance and in research;</li>    <li>Biostatistics and pragmatic trial study design;</li>    <li>Pilot projects;</li>    <li>Participant recruitment, ethics, and regulation;</li>    <li>Evidence synthesis and systematic review; and</li>    <li>Dissemination and implementation, including training and education.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p class=""heading4Indent""><strong>3. Organizational Structure</strong></p>    <p>The Collaboratory will use in-house and external scientific expertise (see Section I.4. for ""Experience and Knowledge"") and have a Consortium Agreement Requirement with health and long-term care systems (see Section VI.2. for Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions of Award) to facilitate core functions. At minimum, the Collaboratory will be comprised of seven core components which will incorporate the features highlighted in Section I.3: (A) Administrative Core; (B) Technical/Data Core; (C) Regulation &amp; Ethics Core; (D) Design/Statistical Core; (E) Pilot Studies Core; (F) Patient &amp; Caregiver Reported Outcomes (PCRO) Core; and (G) Dissemination &amp; Implementation Core. There are (H&amp;I) Optional Cores as well. Applicants are encouraged to address the features described in Section I.2 in the seven Cores, but also have an option to propose two investigator-initiated Cores relevant to AD/ADRD research. Examples of contents of each of the Cores are highlighted below, but are not limited to the following:</p>    <p><strong>A. Administrative Core:</strong></p>    <p>This Core will deliver the primary role to provide administrative support for the Collaboratory. Suggested activities include, but are not limited to:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Providing governance structure for the Collaboratory;</li>    <li>Providing a public website for communication and sharing of activities, events, and resources of the program (see ""<a href=""https://www.nihcollaboratory.org/Pages/default.aspx"">NIH Health Care Research Systems Research Collaboratory</a>"");&nbsp;</li>    <li>Hosting a Living Textbook for conducting AD/ADRD Pragmatic Trials;</li>    <li>Hosting AD/ADRD Pragmatic Trials Grand Rounds;</li>    <li>Collaborating and offering input for pragmatic trials during the planning phase of projects;</li>    <li>Holding a semi-annual national competition for AD/ADRD pilot pragmatic trials and recommending funding of such trials to NIA (individual pilot trials may not exceed $200,000 in direct costs);</li>    <li>Providing organizational and logistical support for the activities of the Collaboratory Cores, Project Scientist(s), Steering Committee, and Collaboratory External Advisory Panel (EAP);</li>    <li>Holding annual research meetings in Bethesda, MD for AD/ADRD pragmatic trials starting in Year 3;</li>    <li>Addressing data interoperability between health systems and between EHR vendors;</li>    <li>Supporting standards and mechanisms to publicly share data, resources, and codes developed and utilized in AD/ADRD pragmatic trial projects supported by both the NIA and the Collaboratory; and</li>    <li>Organizing and supporting two face-to-face meetings of the Collaboratory Cores and Steering Committee in the vicinity of Bethesda, MD for approximately 1.5 days in the first year, annual meetings of similar length in following years, and preparing meeting summaries.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><strong>B. Technical/Data Core:</strong></p>    <p>This Core will facilitate guidance for health systems and electronic health record (EHR) vendors to standardize data structures that capture relevant health outcomes for research on the health of PWD and their caregivers. This may include incorporating recommendations from the Patient &amp; Caregiver Reported Outcomes Core, described below. This core may compile and disseminate methods for using EHRs to:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Identify potential study participants;</li>    <li>Assess the impact of various eligibility criteria on cohort size;</li>    <li>Support real-time or near real-time recruitment to expedite study enrollment;</li>    <li>Automate extraction of demographic and clinical information for reporting and analysis;</li>    <li>Provide real-time support to guide protocol-based management of trial participants;</li>    <li>Track patients and improve follow-up;</li>    <li>Automate clinician notifications to collect trial-specific metrics and outcomes; and</li>    <li>Automate outcome ascertainment occurring over months or years.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>This Core may also establish a remote enclave for sharing sensitive administrative data (e.g., EHRs, private claims records, state registry data) among Collaboratory investigators (i.e., those conducting pilot pragmatic trials) and other NIA-funded AD/ADRD pragmatic trials. Furthermore, it may work with international health systems to standardize EHRs to enable cross-national AD/ADRD research. The inclusion of EHR vendors and/or researchers addressing data interoperability to permit cross-organization collaboration is also encouraged.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>C. Regulation &amp; Ethics Core:</strong></p>    <p>This Core will develop ethics guidelines for conducting pragmatic trials to provide a national resource for the research community. This Core will also develop methods and share best practices for compliance with the various regulatory structures affecting long-term care as well as acute and post-acute care.</p>    <p><strong>D. Design/Statistical Core:</strong></p>    <p>This Core will facilitate and provide design and analysis support for AD/ADRD pilot pragmatic trials. This Core may also develop an AD/ADRD Living Textbook and other guidance documents for conducting pragmatic trials within health care systems. Also, this Core may work with the Technical/Data Core that manages the remote data enclave in order to conduct analyses and replication studies. Concurrently, this Core may conduct statistical analyses of measures and instruments developed in the PCRO Core.</p>    <p><strong>E. Pilot Studies Core:</strong></p>    <p>This Core will support innovative research projects, which may not exceed $200,000 per project (direct cost), for up to $2,500,000 per year (total cost) starting in Year 2. In Year 1, the NIA expects the Collaboratory to hold one annual competition, and the research project budget may not exceed $200,000 per pilot project and up to $1,250,000 (total cost). Pilot projects should be designed to lead to (or inform) the design of larger-scale pragmatic trials. The objectives of the pilot projects are to generate preliminary data for larger research efforts on AD/ADRD relevant pragmatic trials and demonstration projects within health systems. Multi-year pilot projects are not encouraged and will require review and approval by the NIA. The NIA encourages a national competition to invite AD/ADRD pilot applications to be held on a semi-annual basis, with peer review.</p>    <p>Applicants should propose a consolidated or centralized IRB approach consistent with&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/single-irb-policy-multi-site-research.htm"">NIH single IRB policy for multi-site research</a>&nbsp;for trial oversight to facilitate both appropriate and timely study implementation.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>F. Patient &amp; Caregiver Reported Outcomes (PCRO) Core</strong></p>    <p>This Core will develop patient and caregiver-reported outcome measures and instruments relevant to AD/ADRD research that can be captured in EHRs for use in the Technical/Data Core. Additionally, this Core may provide guidance for the creation of efficient, high-quality data collection systems for such measures compatible with EHRs and registries.</p>    <p><strong>G. Dissemination &amp; Implementation Core</strong></p>    <p>This Core will identify from the scientific literature evidence-based AD/ADRD pragmatic trials and disseminate findings across health systems and among researchers. This Core can also assist with implementation activities across health systems. There are limited numbers of pragmatic trials currently funded by the NIA; as such this Core can be limited in scope in the initial years, but it is expected to grow overtime and play a crucial role in dissemination and implementation as many more AD/ADRD pragmatic trials pilot projects are supported by the Collaboratory.</p>    <p><strong>H. Optional Core</strong></p>    <p>Applicants have an option to propose two investigator-initiated Cores which will benefit the overall Collaboratory. Core H must be relevant to AD/ADRD research.</p>    <p><strong>I. Optional Core</strong></p>    <p>Applicants have an option to propose two investigator-initiated Cores which will benefit the overall Collaboratory. Core I must be relevant to AD/ADRD research.</p>    <p class=""heading4Indent"">4. Experience and Knowledge</p>    <p>Collaboratory staff are expected to have significant experience and knowledge in the following areas. The proposed team and its structure should have depth of experience. Such areas of expertise include:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Knowledge of the regulatory requirements for conducting AD/ADRD research with the use of health care data for AD/ADRD research, and experience conducting AD/ADRD research that complies with applicable regulations;</li>    <li>Conducting multi-site research studies with participation by multiple health care delivery organizations that focus on AD/ADRD;</li>    <li>Extracting information from electronic health records (EHRs) and relevant clinical systems for research, and experience with three or more health care systems is preferred;</li>    <li>Familiarity with ethical issues related to AD/ADRD clinical research, clinical care, quality improvement, population health, surveillance, and their boundaries;</li>    <li>Working collaboratively with others including persons with dementia (PWD), research participants, researchers, practitioners, hospital and research informatics and technical personnel, and senior managers of health care and research organizations;</li>    <li>Knowledge of workflows and practices of health care systems and their practitioners;</li>    <li>Workflows and practices of research teams, and experience in design and implementation of randomized studies should be highlighted;</li>    <li>Knowledge and understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of current data models, algorithms, and approaches used by various networks and studies to define clinical phenotypes, extract information, define endpoints, and discover errors in data from health care systems;</li>    <li>Project management experience in taking a research question from idea through implementation to completion;</li>    <li>Study design and statistical expertise&mdash;particularly in pragmatic trials&mdash;as well as novel study designs and methods;</li>    <li>Using creativity and innovation to solve technical and project challenges that respect and promote participation by all relevant communities; and</li>    <li>Reusable and sustainable models for incorporating COAs in health care EHRs and research study management tools, including electronic transfer of information from devices such as home blood pressure monitors.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>It is expected that the Collaboratory will engage nationally with others working in similar areas to stay abreast of emerging experience, regulations, and technical advances that impact the ability for research to be conducted in health care settings.

AD/ADRD Research Collaboratory Program Governance</p>    <p>The award funded under this FOA will be a cooperative agreement (see Section VI.2 Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions of Award). Close interaction with the NIH, pilot grantees and awardees under the Companion FOA (<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-18-585.html"">PAR-18-585</a>) will be required to accomplish the goals of this program.</p>    <p>Cores will be established and will provide essential functions to the overall Collaboratory. It is expected that the Cores will interact with each other. Additionally, the Cores will provide a forum for discussing challenges and solutions across projects; harmonized and standardized policies and processes will be vetted in these groups. Individual Cores are expected to be established in the following areas, at a minimum: Administrative, Technical/Data, Regulation &amp; Ethics, Design/Statistical, Pilot Studies, Patient &amp; Caregiver Reported Outcomes, and Dissemination &amp; Implementation. In addition, the PD/PI can propose two additional Cores.</p>    <p><a name=""_Hlk512494153""></a><strong>A.

The Steering Committee will be composed of a representative from NIA-funded pragmatic trials, PDs/PIs of the Collaboratory, three representatives from the Cores, Project Lead of pilot projects funded through the Collaboratory, three external members which PDs/PIs will appoint with consultation with NIA, and the NIA Projects Scientist(s). Representation from NIA-funded pragmatic trials and pilot projects may not exceed more than two members total. All members are expected to participate actively in all Steering Committee activities. The combined vote of NIH/NIA membership may never exceed 40 percent. It is recommended that PDs/PIs not name the three external members in the application.</p>    <p><strong>B. AD/ADRD Research Collaboratory Program External Advisory Panel (EAP)</strong></p>    <p>An External Advisory Panel for the AD/ADRD Research Collaboratory program will be established to review the progress of all components of the program and provide recommendations to the steering committee. The steering committee will appoint members of the EAP. Membership may include, study investigators, representatives from relevant federal agencies, and independent scientific experts in areas appropriate to the multidisciplinary content of the Collaboratory. The EAP is expected to have 6-8 permanent members; however, membership may expand permanently or on an ad hoc basis as needed. The EAP will meet twice a year, for one in person meeting and one telephone conference. During the first year, the EAP will meet in person twice. At least once a year, there will be a joint meeting with the Steering Committee to allow members of both the EAP and the Steering Committee to interact directly. Twice a year the EAP will make recommendations, in writing, regarding progress of the program to the steering committee and to PD/PI, including changes, if any, that would benefit the program. At the end of Year 3, the EAP will provide recommendations for the continuation or termination of the program, including possible models for sustainability, if continuation is recommended.&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name=""_Hlk508739742""></a>It is recommended that the project be supported by detailed milestones for 5 years.</p>    <p>The applicant must include funds for the Collaboratory PD/PI and key personnel to attend two, one-and-a-half-day Collaboratory program meetings in the first year and an annual meeting in subsequent years in the Bethesda, MD area.

Late phase clinical trials find themselves at the critical juncture between clinical development and market authorisation by the regulators. These trials, which provide evidence to support the product approval process and/or influence policy and practice, are often large in scale, complex and expensive, beyond the resources of a single funder. Coordination and collaboration between partners and funders is essential to leverage the expertise, resources and investments needed that in turn accelerate the development of new or improved products for PRDs and maximise the impact of research funding investments.</p>    <p><strong>Scope</strong></p>    <p>The purpose of this Call for Proposals is to support strategic actions (clinical research activities) that are part of a large-scale clinical trial with the potential to achieve rapid advances in the clinical development of new or improved medical interventions (drugs, diagnostics, vaccines, microbicides) for PRDs. Proposals for a strategic action should focus on phase III study(ies) on PRDs within the remit of the EDCTP2 programme. The proposed EDCTP-funded study(ies) should be conducted in sub-Saharan Africa but may form part of a larger trial that is conducted globally. The clinical trial must be supported by an appropriate regulatory approval and access strategy and/or include plans for uptake into policy and practice at national or international level.</p>    <p>Proposals for a strategic action must also present the broader large-scale clinical trial in its entirety, including details of the component(s) of the trial for which EDCTP funding is requested and the component(s) that are to be financed from other sources. Proposals should make a clear distinction between the broader context (i.e. the large scale clinical trial) as opposed to the proposed action itself (i.e. the specific part of the clinical trial to be funded as a strategic action by the EDCTP Association). The clinical trial must be of a sufficient scale and ambition to justify EDCTP support in combination with financial support from other funders, such as EDCTP2 Participating States and/or third parties.</p>    <p>The total cost of the large-scale clinical trial should not be less than &euro; 10 million and ideally at least half the cost of the large-scale clinical trial should be supported by funders other than the EDCTP Association. EDCTP considers that proposals for a strategic action of between 36 and 60 months duration would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with different total costs and/or a different duration. Proposals for strategic actions that address the priorities outlined in the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.edctp.org/web/app/uploads/2016/12/Strategic-Research-Agenda-version-1-December-2016.pdf"">EDCTP Strategic Research Agenda</a>&nbsp;and that address topics not covered in the scope of the other EDCTP2 calls for proposals launched in 2017 are particularly encouraged.</p>    <p><strong>Expected impact</strong></p>    <p>Actions funded under this Call for Proposals should contribute to increased international cooperation among researchers and funders; catalyse research synergies, and leverage resources and investments in order to achieve rapid advances in the development of new or improved products for PRDs. The large-scale clinical trial supported by the action should have the potential to achieve maximum impact in the field of PRDs and to make a significant contribution to the objectives of the EDCTP2 programme. Proposals that leverage major support from other funders, in particular financial contributions, at the level of the large-scale clinical trial will be considered to have a higher impact.</p>    <p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p>    <p>Consortia comprising a minimum of three independent legal entities are eligible to apply.

Africa accounts for 15-20% of the world&rsquo;s population and a disproportionately large share of disease burden, yet scientific publications by African researchers account for less than 2% of the total academic journal output. The challenge is therefore to enable African researchers to enhance their competitiveness for international funding opportunities early in their careers while retaining them in Africa, working on Africa&rsquo;s health challenges and priorities.</p>    <p>Capacity strengthening needs for health research in Africa have been documented by EDCTP, the World Bank and others. Lack of funding and systematic career development for researchers are two significant gaps. In general, health research capacity building programmes in Africa and other low-income regions are more tailored to PhD candidates than to early-career postdoctoral scientists. Furthermore, international fellowship programmes typically focus on people showing exceptional talent and promise. The experience of global health research funders is that Africans are under-represented and less competitive in their funding schemes: their science may be promising but the framing of research questions; the research design; the proposed analyses and mentoring are often not well developed.</p>    <p>The Africa Research Excellence Fund (AREF) aims to bridge the critical gap early in the career path from research experience to research leadership.

NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. Candidates should review the different career development (K) award programs, to determine the best program to support their goals.More information about Career programs may be found at the&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=41159"">NIH Extramural Training Mechanisms</a>&nbsp;website.</p>    <p>The objective of the NIAID Physician-Scientist Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) is to help address the current shortage of physicians who conduct biomedical research by offering this career development opportunity. Physician-scientists who see patients and perform medical research are ideally positioned to translate laboratory findings about disease mechanisms into clinical interventions that improve patient outcomes. This program supports outstanding eligible postdoctoral researchers who complete mentored training and transition in a timely manner to independent, tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions. The NIAID Physician-Scientists (PS) K99/R00 award is intended to foster the development of a creative, independent research program that will be competitive for subsequent independent funding and that will help advance the mission of NIAID. Applicants must have no more than 4 years of postdoctoral research experience at the time of the initial or the subsequent resubmission or revision application. This program is intended for individuals who require at least 12 months and up to 24 months of mentored research training and career development (K99 phase) before transitioning to the R00 award phase of the program for up to 24 months. Consequently, the strongest applicants will require, and will propose, a well-conceived plan for 1&ndash;2 years of substantive mentored research training and career development that will prepare them to become competitive candidates for tenure-track faculty positions and to launch robust, independent research programs.&nbsp;<em>An individual who cannot provide a compelling rationale for at least one year of additional mentored research training at the time of award is not a strong candidate for this award.</em></p>    <p><em>Individuals must be in mentored, postdoctoral training positions to be eligible to apply. If an applicant achieves independence (any faculty or non-mentored research position) before a K99 award is made, neither the K99, nor the R00 award, will be made.</em></p>    <p>The NIAID PS K99/R00 award will provide up to 4 years of support in two phases. The initial (K99) phase will provide support for up to 2 years of mentored postdoctoral research training and career development. In the second (R00) phase, NIAID will provide up to 2 years of independent research support, which is contingent on satisfactory progress during the K99 phase and an approved, independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty position. The two award phases are intended to be continuous in time. Therefore, although exceptions may be possible in limited circumstances, R00 awards will generally only be made to those K99 PDs/PIs who accept independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty positions by the end of the K99 award period.</p>    <p>For the purposes of this program, physician-scientists include individuals with an MD, DO, DDS/DMD, DVM/VMD, MD/PhD, DNP, or nurses with research doctoral degrees who devote the majority of their time to biomedical research. This K99/R00 is intended for those physician-scientists who already have substantial research training and are dedicated to initiating a strong, research-intensive career as physician-scientists. This program is designed to facilitate a timely transition of outstanding physician-scientists from mentored, research positions to independent, tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions, and to provide independent NIAID research support during the transition. Individuals who need a longer period of mentored career development before they are prepared to begin the transition to research independence should consider the K08 or K23 program (see:&nbsp;<a href=""https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/career-development"">K Kiosk</a>).</p>    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;The following types of applications will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;be supported by this PA:</p>    <ul>    <li>Applications that do not propose at least one specific aim focused in clinical and/or translational research.

These small molecules could be further developed into stand-alone immunotherapeutics or synergistic partners for existing therapies, or as chemical probes for the discovery and validation of novel targets involved in anti-tumor immunity. Investigators from multiple scientific disciplines (immuno-oncology, tumor biology, screening technology, medicinal chemistry, and pharmacology) are encouraged to establish collaborative teams to discover and develop novel small molecule immunomodulators for cancer therapy. This FOA encourages the design of research projects that utilize the following phases of discovery research: 1) assay development specifically designed for immuno-oncology targets with the intent to screen for novel small molecule compounds that show potential as either probes or drugs, or as pre-therapeutic leads; 2) screen implementation for immunomodulatory targets to identify initial screening hits (from high throughput target-focused approaches or moderate throughput phenotypic- and fragment-based approaches); 3) hit validation through secondary orthogonal and counter screening assays, and hit prioritization; and 4) hit-to-lead optimization.</p>    <p>Applicants who propose basic studies that involve the identification and analysis of mechanisms contributing to tumor immune evasion are encouraged to apply for&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-17-330.html"">PA-17-330</a>.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p>Cancer immunotherapy development to date has predominantly focused on biological agents that modulate the efficiency of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) e.g. monoclonal antibodies that block inhibitory checkpoint molecule signaling in T cells and genetically engineered T cells with specific T cell antigen receptors to boost the recognition of tumor-associated antigens. Despite the impressive clinical efficacy observed in the immunotherapy of some cancers, only a limited number of patients respond to these therapies.</p>    <p>Increasing evidence suggests that tumor cells can evade the potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses augmented by biological immunotherapies through an immune-suppressive microenvironment, which consists of a variety of interacting cell types, proteins and pathways. Many potential therapeutic targets have recently been identified in the tumor microenvironment that may be amenable for intervention using small molecules (e.g. cytokines, suppressive metabolites, stromal factors and cell surface molecules expressed on immune suppressor cells).</p>    <p>Modulating the immune system or the tumor microenvironment through a small-molecule approach offers advantages that are complementary to and potentially synergistic with the use of protein and cell immunotherapies as well as conventional chemotherapy. The advantages include the capability to tackle intracellular targets, the feasibility of oral bioavailability, the potential of improved tissue penetration, and the adaptability to combination therapies. Small molecules could also serve as chemical probes to discover, characterize and validate novel mechanisms involved in anti-tumor immunity. Because of their ability to bind specific protein domains and reversibly inhibit protein-protein interactions, small molecules are particularly suitable for the investigation of the diverse mechanisms and pathways contributing to immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment.</p>    <p>Although small molecule libraries, either generated through combinatorial chemistry or derived from natural sources, have been extensively screened against a variety of targets in tumor cells for direct inhibition of tumor growth, they have rarely been screened against targets in immune cells responding to tumor antigens or against targets in the tumor microenvironment, providing potential for modifying immune responses to tumor. Another key challenge of using high throughput screening (HTS) approaches for the discovery of small molecule immunomodulators is the development of robust, sensitive and scalable assays to address the complexity of measuring and enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. While target-based screenings would allow rapid identification of small molecules modifying a specific protein target with defined function, phenotypic screenings could potentially be more productive in addressing the complex immune response network and in identifying agents that enhance the antitumor immune response via novel mechanisms. Follow-up hit confirmation and lead development also require assays that are carefully designed with consideration of the complexity of antitumor immunity, including interplay between cancer cells and immune and non-immune cell types in the tumor microenvironment. Finally, selection of specific tumor model systems is also a critical element for the development of anti-cancer small molecule immunomodulators, as such immunomodulators will not necessarily exert the same effects across different types of tumors. Therefore, the discovery of small molecule drugs capable of engaging the immune system to inhibit tumor growth requires innovative thinking along with enabling models and technologies, which is the emphasis of this funding opportunity. &nbsp;</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives and Scope</strong></div>    <p>The primary objective of this FOA is to facilitate the discovery of small molecule immunomodulators for cancer therapy. Projects focusing on immune targets amenable for small molecule intervention may span any of the following stages of drug discovery research: 1) assay development; 2) primary screen implementation; 3) hit validation; and 4) hit to lead optimization. For applications requesting support for more than one stage, with some exceptions (see below), demonstration of feasibility is needed. Applicants are expected to provide strong rationale and preliminary data to justify the stage of the discovery research and to predict the feasibility of the proposed stage of the discovery research to move on to the next stage of the drug discovery process. Areas to be considered for each stage are described below and instructions are given in Section IV.</p>    <p><strong>1. Assay Development for Novel Small Molecule Immunomodulators</strong></p>    <p>This FOA encourages the development of assays for immunomodulatory targets and pathways that would result in the eventual discovery and development of novel small molecules as useful drug leads for cancer immunotherapy. Projects for assay development should emphasize the design and validation of creative approaches to assay valid and relevant immune response readouts that have potential to be used for chemical probe and drug discovery for cancer therapy.</p>    <p>Primary assays may be target-, pathway-, or phenotype-based. Some examples of targets or pathways involved in host tumor immune responses include, but are not limited to: (i) immune checkpoint molecules that inhibit anti-tumor responses; (ii) enzymes involved in reprogrammed metabolic pathways within the tumor microenvironment that in turn modulate tumor-infiltrating immune cells; (iii)chemokine receptors on cells in the tumor microenvironment that modulate the activity of immunosuppressive lymphocytes; (iv) signal transduction pathway modulators expressed in lymphocytes and myeloid lineage cells that regulate immune responses to tumor; and (v) toll-like receptors (TLRs) involved in immune surveillance of tumors.</p>    <p>For phenotype-based assays, the primary assay should model anti-tumor immune response and be suitable for medium or high throughput screening. For example, the reactivation of &ldquo;exhausted&rdquo; T cells could be measured in the context of environmental cues coming from suppressor cells or their soluble suppressor products. Direct activation of &ldquo;exhausted&rdquo; T cells (e.g. by stimulating T cells through the TCR in the absence of TME suppressive factors) could also be tested. Direct inhibition of the activation and/or proliferation of immunosuppressive cells (e.g. T regulatory cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells, or tolerogenic monocytes) could also be assayed. Preference will be given to assays that are most representative of the activation of T cells in a complex suppressive tumor microenvironment.</p>    <p>Applicants are encouraged to collaborate with an experienced screening facility to determine the feasibility of assays for high- or medium-throughput screening (see&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.slas.org/resources/information/academic-screening-facilities/"">Academic Screening Facilities Directory</a>;&nbsp;<a title=""Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"" href=""http://addconsortium.org/index.php"">Academic Drug Discovery Consortium</a>). Additional considerations for the design and testing of a primary assay may be found in Section IV under PHS 398 Research Plan.</p>    <p><strong>2. Primary Screen Implementation</strong></p>    <p>Projects focusing on primary screen implementation of small molecule immunomodulators are expected to provide preliminary data demonstrating that a primary screen has been developed, fully characterized, and tested in a pilot format. In addition, primary screen implementation projects should be proposed in conjunction with assay development or hit validation (if a well-developed primary assay is already available). Applicants are encouraged to collaborate with an experienced screening facility, particularly if high throughput screening (HTS) is planned. The screening facility may provide advice such as identification and selection of commercial HTS assay reagents, and suitable HTS assay format and readout.</p>    <p><strong>See Section IV (PHS 398 Research Plan) for further details on expected information prior to the Primary Screen Implementation stage.</strong></p>    <p><strong>3. Hit Validation</strong></p>    <p>For validating small molecule immunomodulators obtained from primary screens, investigators may conduct advanced cheminformatics analysis and chemistry inspection to prioritize the hit series. Development of orthogonal and counter screen assays to triage the hits are expected. Applicants are encouraged to collaborate with an experienced screening facility for developing orthogonal assays to validate the screening hits and chemical improvement of the initial hits via a structure-activity relationship (SAR) study following hit validation. Investigators should verify the purity and structure of hits using a combination of analytical methods and, when necessary, re-synthesis of selected hits.</p>    <p><strong>4. Hit-to-lead Optimization</strong></p>    <p>For chemical optimization projects, applicants should have a validated chemical hit as the starting point. The validated hit should have the following properties: (i) elicit a reproducible response in at least two assay types, and elicit a dose-response over a hundred-fold concentration range; (ii) be analytically validated in terms of integrity and purity (e.g., use of resynthesized powder sample of high purity in the preliminary assays); (iii) demonstrate adequate potency; and (iv) possess a tractable starting point of chemical optimization with no obvious major chemical liabilities. Investigators should implement SAR assays that measure target engagement, target selectivity, and functional assays quantifying immunomodulation of the analogues.

For instance, whether prior studies of the selected target were adequately controlled and powered are important considerations. Were cell lines verified, plasmids sequenced, and protein reagents tested for contaminants?</li>    <li>Second, reproducibility of the proposed primary assay should be carefully considered because this assay is often the basis for assessing not only initial hits, but also for iteratively assessing optimized hits during structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. Development of primary screening assays that test a key biological function of the target of interest are likely to yield hits of increased relevance. In this respect, phenotypic screens have had a resurgence.</li>    <li>Third, a hit validation scheme or &ldquo;critical path&rdquo; that includes orthogonal assay(s) to eliminate false positives, as well as a series of assays in diverse biological systems with diverse read-outs, particularly including assays that model human disease, is likely to yield hits of increased relevance.</li>    <li>Fourth, inclusion of skilled synthetic and/or medicinal chemists to assess the validity of the hit chemotypes to eliminate PAINS (pan-assay interference compounds) or other undesirable chemotypes.</li>    <li>A final area for improvement is the optimization of hits to yield high quality probes. Technological innovations in high throughput screening, chemical synthesis, and cheminformatics have allowed rapid discovery of novel, small-molecule probes for the study of disease related biological processes and mechanisms in academic environments (see&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.slas.org/resources/information/academic-screening-facilities/"">Academic Screening Facilities Directory</a>;&nbsp;<a title=""Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"" href=""http://addconsortium.org/index.php"">Academic Drug Discovery Consortium</a>). The&nbsp;<a title=""Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"" href=""http://www.chemicalprobes.org/"">Chemical Probes Portal</a>, established in July 2015, provides a list of credentialed probes. It is noted that probes may be the predecessors of drugs, but drugs with known off-target effects are seldom useful as probes of specific biological activities. Importantly, identification of chemical probe(s) for a given target provides an unprecedented opportunity for investigators to translate knowledge about diseases into tangible tools for translational research and opens the door to validation of the target prior to clinical testing.</li>    </ul>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Scope:</strong></div>    <p>Projects for this FOA may span up to three stages of discovery research:</p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent"">1) assay development;</p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent"">2) primary screen implementation; and</p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent"">3) hit validation.</p>    <p>For applications requesting support for more than one stage, demonstration of feasibility is needed, including strong justification and supporting preliminary data for the stages proposed. Areas to be considered for each stage are described below and given in greater detail in Section IV (Application and Submission Information, PHS 398 Research Plan).</p>    <p><strong>1. Assay Development</strong></p>    <p>This FOA seeks to apply new knowledge and screening technologies to develop assays for novel targets and pathways. Projects for assay development should emphasize the design and validation of creative approaches to assay biological and disease processes that have potential to be used for chemical probe or drug discovery. Assays focusing on areas and approaches that have been extensively studied should be avoided unless a strong rationale is provided for additional studies in the projected area. Targets associated with rare and neglected diseases are encouraged.</p>    <p>Proposed primary screening assays should be relevant to the scope of the research within at least one of the participating NIH ICs focusing on specific diseases or on relevant basic physiology, cell biology, or developmental processes that provide insight into a disease.</p>    <p><strong><em>Primary screening assays may be target-, pathway-, or phenotype-based</em></strong>. Some examples include:</p>    <ul>    <li>target-based biochemical or cellular assays that measure activities of enzymes, receptor-ligand binding, protein-protein interactions, ion channels, transporters, nuclear receptors and other transcription factors, and other new targets emerging from genetic and proteomic research in model systems and in human diseases;</li>    <li>cell- or organism-based assays that detect phenotypic changes that may involve unidentified molecular targets; and</li>    <li>non-traditional targets of interest such as nucleic acids, protein folding, polymorphic gene products, post-transcriptional editing or gene splicing factors, and protein or RNA stabilizers.</li>    </ul>    <p><em>Assay detection methods may include, but are not limited to:</em></p>    <ul>    <li>fluorescence, luminescence, absorbance;</li>    <li>fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET);</li>    <li>time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET);</li>    <li>fluorescence polarization;</li>    <li>flow cytometric measurements;</li>    <li>fluorescence imaging;</li>    <li>bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET);</li>    <li>AlphaScreen, scintillation proximity assay (SPA);</li>    <li>electrophysiological assays, and;</li>    <li>biophysical assays.</li>    </ul>    <p>In general, assays should adopt an adequate detection principle that results in a sensitive detection of even weak binders with expected low rates of false positives and false negatives. Complementary research including virtual screening may also be conducted to improve the likelihood of success and cost effectiveness.</p>    <p>Additional considerations for the design and testing of a primary assay may be found in Section IV (Application and Submission Information, PHS 398 Research Plan).</p>    <p><strong>2. Primary Screen Implementation</strong></p>    <p>Applicants are encouraged to collaborate with an experienced screening facility, particularly if high throughput screening (HTS) is planned. The screening facility may provide advice such as identification and selection of commercial HTS assay reagents, and suitable HTS assay format and readout. In addition, the screening facility may be able to provide assistance in adapting assays to an HTS format (e.g., 1536-well or 384-well microplate) and performing a pilot screen of a small library of compounds. Further, the researchers might seek advice from the screening laboratory about orthogonal assays to validate the screening hits, and about chemical improvement of the initial hits via a structure-activity relationship (SAR) study following hit validation.</p>    <p>Projects focusing on screen implementation are encouraged to provide preliminary data demonstrating that a primary screen has been developed, fully characterized, and tested in a pilot format. See Section IV for further details on expected information prior to the Primary Screen Implementation stage.</p>    <p>Other technical resources about assay development and screening include the online comprehensive guidebook (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53196/"">Assay Guidance Manual</a>), assay protocols deposited on the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pcassay"">PubChem BioAssay</a>&nbsp;data base,&nbsp;<a href=""https://nihguide.nih.gov/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/X1SODTRB/Other%20technical%20resources%20about%20HTS%20assay%20development%20include%20the%20online%20comprehensive%20guidebook%20Assay%20Guidance%20Manual%20(http:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53196/),%20HTS%20assay%20protocols%20deposited%20on%20PubChem%20BioAssay%20data%20base%20(http:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pcassay),%20ASSAY%20and%20Drug%20Development%20Technologies,%20a%20peer-reviewed%20bimonthly%20journal,%20and%20the%20Journal%20of%20Biomolecular%20Screening."">ASSAY and Drug Development Technologies</a>, a peer-reviewed bimonthly journal, and the&nbsp;<a title=""Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"" href=""http://journals.sagepub.com/home/jbx"">Journal of Biomolecular Screening</a>.</p>    <p><strong>3. Hit validation</strong></p>    <p>Hits from a primary screen may be systematically assessed using a cascade of follow-up assays to efficiently and effectively remove false positives. Primary HTS assays typically generate hundreds to thousands of hits, many of which are false positives or are chemically intractable. Hits from smaller scale primary screens are also likely to generate false positives or chemically intractable molecules that require additional screens. Post-primary screening assays may include:</p>    <ul>    <li>an assay that is essentially identical to the primary assay but with an orthogonal detection scheme (e.g., switching light detection mode or wavelength to avoid intrinsic compound interference);</li>    <li>a target-minus assay (e.g., coupling enzymes in the absence of the assay target enzyme, parental cell line without the assay target protein, etc.);</li>    <li>an assay that is different in biological context and process (e.g., protein functional assay vs. protein binding assay; RT-PCR and Western assay vs. reporter gene assay; cell-based assay vs. biochemical assay);</li>    <li>cytotoxicity assay;</li>    <li>target selectivity assay(s);</li>    <li>specificity assays to distinguish biological activities of chemical entities among orthologous targets across organism species through kingdoms (e.g., yeast vs. mammalian cell targets; parasite vs. host targets);</li>    <li>mode of action assays (e.g., allosteric vs. orthosteric; competitive vs. noncompetitive or uncompetitive); and</li>    <li>target identification assays. The assays farther downstream may also include cellular and tissue models pertaining to the relevant physiology or pathophysiology.</li>    <li>assays farther downstream may include cellular and tissue models pertaining to relevant physiology or pathophysiology, or to mode and mechanism of action of the validated hits. In vivo assays (e.g. whole animal models) should only be proposed if they are needed to demonstrate the biological or physiological effects of lead compound(s).</li>    </ul>    <p>In addition, investigators should conduct advanced cheminformatics analysis and medicinal chemistry inspection to prioritize the hit set. It is expected that the investigators will test powder samples of hit compounds and commercially available analog compounds during the hit validation stage. Investigators should verify the structure of hits using a combination of analytical methods and, if possible, re-synthesis of select hits.</p>    <p>Screening campaigns may yield validated hits that can be further optimized via medicinal chemistry. Extensive medicinal chemistry optimization is not appropriate for this FOA. Investigators of a successful screening project are encouraged to consider further funding opportunities to support medicinal chemistry optimization of the validated hits (e.g. see &ldquo;Institute Interests&rdquo; below).</p>    <p><strong>Institute Interests</strong></p>    <p><strong>NCI:&nbsp;</strong>Assays and screens pertinent to the mission of NCI should be justified in the application as relevant to cancer. Of interest to NCI are assays and screens to identify or evaluate small molecules for use in elucidating molecular, cellular, or in vivo mechanisms or processes of probable or known importance in cancer biology, and for use in developing strategies for cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment or clinical monitoring of treatment. Discovery of small molecule probes, preventive or therapeutic drug leads, or imaging agent leads are of interest. NCI encourages projects focusing on small molecules that specifically target pediatric fusion oncoproteins or that address novel targets in small cell lung cancer or pancreatic cancer.

Applications may focus on assays targeting etiologic agents of human infectious disease including, but not limited to, potential agents of biodefense (categories A, B, and C), as well as other newly emerging infectious agents&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/emerging-infectious-diseases-pathogens"">NIAID Emerging Infectious Diseases/Pathogens</a>&nbsp;with high global burdens of disease, such as tuberculosis and malaria, as well as toxins or arthropod vectors of infectious agents as targets will also be included, along with viral pathogens of public health consequence that establish intracellular reservoirs and are uniquely challenging drug targets (i.e., HIV and HBV). Additionally, applications may focus on augmenting immune responses towards infectious pathogens or vaccines.&nbsp; Such studies may include, identification of molecules that target immune molecules to enhance early innate immune responses and/or induce or prolong immunological memory to vaccination (e.g., adjuvants, immunomodulators). Also of prime interest is the prevention, amelioration, or reversal of immune-mediated diseases by small molecules. Targets relevant to asthma, allergy, inflammatory diseases, transplant rejection, and all types of autoimmune diseases may be proposed. Assays that facilitate studies on basic immunological mechanisms are also appropriate, including the development of small molecules to track/visualize immune cells in vivo or in vitro (e.g., nanobodies, imaging probes).</p>    <p><strong>NIDA:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;NIDA is interested in the discovery and development of HTS assays that can be used to identify small molecules that elucidate underlying molecular, cellular, or in vivo mechanisms of probable processes or known importance to addiction biology. NIDA is particularly interested in assays that can be applied to future opioid use disorder, chronic pain pharmacotherapeutic development or treatment of overdose. Assays can be biochemically, cellularly or behaviorally based.&nbsp;Related chemical discovery opportunities include: Chemical Discovery Program (<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-16-384.html"">PAR-16-384</a>), Drug Discovery For Nervous System Disorders (<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-16-041.html"">PAR-16-041</a>), and the Chemistry Science Track Award for Rapid Transition (C/START) (<a href=""https://nih-my.sharepoint.com/personal/forryscs_nih_gov/Documents/Chemistry%20Science%20Track%20Award%20for%20Rapid%20Transition%20(C/START)"">PAR-16-383</a>).

The performance, and publication, of analytical method validation studies make critical contributions to enhancing experimental design and supporting the authentication and characterization of key experimental reagents. The use of validated methods enhances the reliability and consistency of analytical results, and the dissemination of validated methods developed in the course of NIH-supported research multiplies the value of that research. Funds are available through this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) to support formal validation studies of analytical methods for the accurate, precise, specific, and sensitive quantification of chemical constituents of dietary supplements in experimental formulations or in biological samples.</p>    <p>Relatively few publicly available and validated analytical methods exist for bioactive constituents in food and dietary supplements. This makes it difficult to rigorously assess the composition of experimental materials and to conduct reproducible studies assessing mechanism, efficacy, or safety of dietary supplements. A major goal of The Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS)'s Analytical Methods and Reference Materials (AMRM) Program is to promote development and validation of methods that quantify dietary supplement constituents, contaminants, adulterants, and their metabolites. This funding opportunity seeks to complement AMRM efforts involving the dietary supplement industry and regulatory authorities by leveraging quantitative analytical methods that have been developed by NIH grantees. These methods may or may not have been previously published and the details of the methods or their documented validation may not be available to the broader research community.</p>    <p>A validated method is a method that has been systematically evaluated for performance characteristics including accuracy, precision, and reliability (2013 AOAC International Official Methods of Analysis, Appendix K: Guidelines for Dietary Supplements and Botanicals;&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.eoma.aoac.org/app_k.pdf"">http://www.eoma.aoac.org/app_k.pdf</a>, accessed 4/13/2017). Experimental approaches to demonstrate the validity of a quantitative analytical method include single-laboratory and multiple-laboratory validation studies. A method that has been developed and used in a laboratory can be validated for applicability, accuracy, precision, and repeatability within that same laboratory in a single-laboratory validation (SLV) study, which is the mechanism for demonstrating method performance prior to subjecting the method to a multi-laboratory study. A multi-laboratory collaborative study provides a higher level of confidence in method performance in that it permits an evaluation of the method's reproducibility among different laboratories.</p>    <p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>    <p>This Administrative Supplement funding opportunity announcement seeks applications for the conduct of single-laboratory validation (SLV) studies of rigorous analytical methods for the quantification of chemical constituents (e.g., active or marker chemical compounds, adulterants, contaminants), or metabolites thereof, in foods, dietary supplements, their raw source materials, and/or clinical specimens (e.g., urine or plasma).</p>    <p>Methods to be the subject of validation studies must have already been developed and be in use by the applicant at the time of the supplement request. These methods must have been developed and/or used within the scope of the active parent NIH award. While it is understood that further method optimization is often required in the course of a validation study (and funding requests should take this into account), the purpose of this supplement is not to support de novo method development or initial optimization of newly developed methods.</p>    <p>Applications for multiple-laboratory, collaborative validation studies will not be accepted at this time.</p>    <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>    <p>The grantee is expected to publish the validated method and results of the validation study in a peer-reviewed journal, and to cite support by ODS as well as by the IC administering the parent award, in addition to meeting all requirements as described in Section VI.</p>    <p>Applicants must have at least 18 months of active support remaining on the parent grant as of the application due date.</p>    <p>Several policies, guidelines, and procedures have been established for the design and conduct of validation studies for quantitative analytical methods.

This emerging area promotes the concept that cell death pathways are interconnected and cells resistant to one type of cell death may become sensitive to other types of cell death, leading to novel therapeutic opportunities. The long-term goal is to understand how cancer cell death programs intersect at the molecular level so that the specific mediators of cell survival may be inhibited and/or the mediators of cell death enhanced, driving cancer cells toward effective cell death.&nbsp; Understanding the basics of cell death crosstalk in cancer is important in addressing current and future challenges in targeting cancer cell death as a therapeutic approach. Furthermore, revealing differences in cell death profiles across cancer types and within individual cancer patients will help to develop precise tools to treat drug-resistant cancers.</p>    <p>This FOA utilizes the Exploratory/Developmental Grant (R21) mechanism, which supports investigation of novel scientific ideas or new model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical research.</p>    <p>An R21 grant application should not have extensive background material or preliminary information.

Regulated cell death especially apoptosis and necroptosis, are natural barriers that can restrict malignant cells from surviving and disseminating. Evasion of cell death is one of the hallmarks of cancer, contributing to tumor progression, metastases and resistance to therapy.</p>    <p>Three major types of cell regulated death, defined in large part by the morphology of the dying cell, have been well-studied: apoptosis (also known as type I cell death), autophagic cell death (type II), and necrosis (type III). Slight to moderate damage and low levels of death signaling typically induce apoptosis, whereas severe damage and high levels of death signaling often result in necrosis/necroptosis.</p>    <p>Although apoptosis is often the preferred mode of cell death and although necroptosis is often triggered only as a backup mechanism to ensure that cell death occurs, emerging evidence has shown that the necroptotic pathway may predominate under certain pathological conditions. Cells resistant to one type of cell death can modify their response to damage and eventually activate alternative cell death pathways.</p>    <p>Other types of cell death such as ferroptosis, pyroptosis and some others have been recently recognized and the interplay between these processes remains an under-explored area that can have impact on therapeutic targeting.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives and Scope of the FOA</strong></div>    <p>The primary goal of this FOA is to stimulate basic and preclinical research that will address knowledge gaps and technical limitations in studying crosstalk of cell death pathways in cancer.</p>    <p><strong>Descriptive versus Hypothesis driven Aims:</strong></p>    <p>Drug resistant cancer cells may involve processes that are significantly altered or exploit new dimensions of biology that have not yet been described.

In the context of this FOA, systems developmental biology is defined as research focused on understanding how biological components work together to produce the complex biological phenomena encompassing embryonic development.</p>    <p>Systems developmental biology is an emergent field utilizing the approaches of systems biology to integrate the expanding molecular-level knowledge of genes, proteins, biochemical, biophysical and cellular processes into networks of interacting components that result in embryonic development. Systems developmental biology offers the potential to complement the reductionist focus of modern developmental biology and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the causal relationships leading to normal and abnormal embryogenesis.</p>    <p>Over the past several decades the approaches used by developmental biologists to study embryogenesis have resulted in a wealth of detailed molecular-level descriptions of developmental phenomena. The successes of hypothesis-driven reductionist approaches have taught us that development is exceptionally complex and that simple intuitive models of developmental processes are insufficient for comprehending this enormous complexity. Ultimately, a more profound understanding of development requires the assimilation of many levels of genomic, biochemical, and biophysical information into models that are quantitative, predictive, and experimentally verifiable.</p>    <p>Recent advances in genomic sequencing, rapid analysis of gene regulatory elements, and quantitative multiplex assays of gene expression make it feasible to expand systems biology approaches to network analyses of embryonic development. Such network models for embryonic development offer the potential to link isolated molecular and mechanistic descriptions of developmental processes into a foundational framework allowing important causal relationships to be identified and predictively understood. However, before these goals can be achieved there are substantial conceptual, technological, and cultural challenges to overcome. This FOA addresses these challenges.</p>    <p>Systems biology is evolving as an integrated experimental, informational, and computational science.</p>    <ul>    <li>In contrast to focusing exclusively on the properties of individual molecules and pathways, systems biology centers on understanding how biological components work together to produce system-wide outcomes. One type of systems biology approach is a &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; data-driven &ldquo;omics&rdquo; approach which seeks to identify components and potential network interactions within a biological system. In contrast, a second type of systems biology is a &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; approach which focuses on building models of interactions to provide a predictive understanding of the causal relationships driving physiological and developmental processes. These approaches are often combined and may require the integration of expertise across traditionally separated scientific disciplines potentially involving the collaboration of biologists, clinicians, physicists, chemists, and computer scientists.</li>    </ul>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Scope</strong></div>    <p>Application of systems biology tools to address developmental questions in many ways represents a paradigm shift for developmental biology and birth defects research. Since these approaches and their application are evolving, this FOA is not intended to be proscriptive in scope. Examples of research areas of interest include but are not limited to:</p>    <ul>    <li>Efforts to compile new and to integrate existing data sets regarding signaling pathways, signal transduction cascades, biophysical processes, epigenetic modifications, and transcription factor hierarchies into regulatory network models of developmental processes;</li>    <li>Analysis of existing or new data sets to identify connections between genes, pathways, or processes that are involved in developmental processes or the formation of structural birth defects;</li>    <li>&nbsp;</li>    <li>Experimental validation of network models for developmental processes;</li>    <li>Development of computational or experimental tools for constructing, perturbing, and/or validating models of developmental processes;</li>    <li>Development of or improvements to computational tools for constructing or displaying network models of developmental processes, particularly those that predict outcomes from in silico perturbations.</li>    </ul>    <p>Projects proposed for this FOA need not be either hypothesis-driven or experimentally based and can make use of any multicellular model organism.

Overview</strong></p>    <p>This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is part of a suite of complementary programs to encourage the translation of research discoveries into new treatments for disorders that fall under the NINDS mission.</p>    <p>The NINDS Cooperative Research to Enable and Advance Translational Enterprises for Biologics (CREATE Bio) program is dedicated to biotechnology product- and biologics-based therapies, which broadly include modalities such as peptides, proteins, oligonucleotides, gene therapies, cell therapies and novel emerging modalities.&nbsp; The program includes two tracks: &nbsp;the Optimization Track supports optimization in order to obtain a candidate appropriate for entering the Development Track, and the Development Track supports IND-enabling studies for the candidate.</p>    <p>For entry into the Optimization Track, projects must have strong scientific rationale and demonstrate relevant, convincing in vivo data of one or more agent(s) that are sufficiently profiled so that the parameters to be optimized can be quantitatively specified (see entry criteria for details) in the application.&nbsp; At the end of the funding period, a candidate should be identified that has sufficient bioactivity, stability, manufacturability, bioavailability, in vivo efficacy and/or target engagement (measurement of target binding or proximal downstream effects) with defined minimal and optimal doses, and other favorable properties consistent with the desired clinical application (see Scope below for details).</p>    <p>Projects are funded through the SBIR U44 cooperative agreement award mechanism, which involves NINDS Scientific/Research staff's participation in developing the project plan, monitoring research progress, and establishing appropriate milestones.&nbsp; NINDS staff will also provide assistance to academic investigators in guiding them with the therapeutic development process and the criteria needed to advance therapeutic leads to the clinic.&nbsp;</p>    <p>For more information about earlier stage translational funding opportunities and programs, visit the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Research-Funded-NINDS/Translational-Research"">NINDS Division of Translational Research</a>&nbsp;website and, for more information&nbsp;specifically about the&nbsp;<a href=""https://ninds.nih.gov/Research-Funded-NINDS/CREATE-BIO"">CREATE Bio Program</a>, visit the website.&nbsp; Applicants are strongly advised to read through the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Funding/Apply-Funding/Application-Support-Library/CREATE-Program-FAQs"">CREATE Program FAQs</a>.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>B. Scope</strong></div>    <p>Projects should focus on a single disorder that falls within the NINDS mission.</p>    <p>The CREATE Bio FOAs focus on biotechnology products and biologics, which broadly include modalities such as peptides, proteins, oligonucleotides, gene therapies, cell therapies and novel emerging modalities. &nbsp;Applicants should contact NINDS Scientific/Research staff regarding small peptide derivatives, natural products, molecules with complex structures, or combination products, to determine the fit for this FOA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong><em>Entry Criteria:</em></strong></p>    <p>Applicants are encouraged to talk to NINDS Scientific/Research staff about the stage of their activity and receive advice as to which program is the best fit.&nbsp; Applicants cannot simultaneously submit both an Optimization and Development Track application on the same agent and disease.</p>    <p><strong><em>To be eligible for funding through this Optimization Track FOA, projects must meet the following criteria:</em></strong></p>    <p>(1) One or more biological agents sufficiently profiled so that the parameters to be optimized can be quantitatively specified.</p>    <p>Note: NINDS recognizes that, depending on the type of agent and how it was identified and characterized, projects will enter at different stages, where certain required properties may have been optimized (repurposing a marketed therapy for a new indication is an extreme example). In the case of repurposing, the applications must show feasibility to proceed to an Investigation New Drug (IND) or IND exemption application, assuming the results from the Optimization Track funding period are positive.&nbsp; For example, the applicants should have collaborations that enable access to existing toxicology or human trial data required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and have the decision rights or partnership(s) to further the development of the agent for the proposed new indication.</p>    <p>2) In vivo efficacy and target engagement using existing agent(s) in relevant animal model(s) to support scientific premise that the proposed mechanism of action (MOA) and modulation of the target are likely to result in a therapeutic outcome. The agent(s) should show in vivo efficacy using clinically relevant outcome measures (e.g., anatomical, and functional when possible) and in vivo target engagement (measurement of target binding or proximal downstream effects) at the clinically intended site of action, using sufficient experimental and statistical rigor.</p>    <p>3) Data demonstrating that the key in vitro and in vivo assays proposed are suitable for the proposed purpose and are available in either the applicant's or collaborator's laboratories.&nbsp; Appropriate controls should be employed and efforts should be taken to demonstrate dynamic detection range and acceptable variability so the feasibility of conducting the proposed studies can be adequately assessed.</p>    <p>4) An established and engaged multi-disciplinary project team to execute the proposed pre-clinical development plan that will deliver an optimized therapeutic candidate at the end of the funding period.</p>    <p><strong><em>At the end of this Optimization Track, successful projects should have minimally achieved the following:</em></strong></p>    <p>(1) Optimization is finished and the final characterization of the candidate, such as structure/identity, selectivity, stability, manufacturability, and other modality- specific characteristics is complete.</p>    <p>(2) For a candidate with sufficient purity, its minimal effective dose, optimal effective dose, and time and duration of treatment have been determined in relevant in vivo assays using clinically relevant functional and/or anatomical outcome measures, and/or in vivo target engagement assays.&nbsp; [This normally should have been done using the clinically intended route of administration and special formulations if proposed (such as slow release, liposomes, nanoparticles, etc.), unless justified to use other routes of administration in which case the dose-response must have been reliably bridged by pharmacokinetics measurements]. The in vivo study results should also include assessment of pharmacokinetics, bioavailability at the relevant site of action, and pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics relationship. In particular for CNS disorders, there needs to be rigorous evidence that the agent is blood-brain-barrier penetrant (unless the agent is proposed to be delivered directly to the CNS) and available at an effective dose, or evidence that the agent can act in the periphery.&nbsp; Key studies should be sufficiently replicated, powered and controlled with experimental and statistical rigor to lend a high degree of confidence in the results, with sufficient information available about study design, execution, analysis, and interpretation.&nbsp;</p>    <p>(3) Feasibility of reproducible production of the candidate.</p>    <p>Only the most promising agents that have undergone rigorous preclinical testing and are considered state-of-the-art for the disease of interest will be considered for advancement to IND-enabling studies in the Development Track. &nbsp;&nbsp;This Optimization Track thus affords applicants the opportunity to build collaborations, conduct comparative studies among related agents and standard of care agents, and, ultimately, advance their most promising candidate therapeutics.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong><em>Activities Appropriate for this FOA include, but are not limited to:</em></strong></p>    <ul>    <li>Optimization of the agents, like improvement of potency, specificity, bioavailability, and suitability for human testing, etc.&nbsp; Specific examples include but are not limited to: optimize selectivity/specificity, selection of the best promoter or viral serotype for a gene therapy product, ideal length and/or sequence of an miRNA derivative to hone its specificity, optimization of a protein for an acceptable stability in vitro or half-life in vivo, humanization of a mouse monoclonal antibody, minimizing a predicted or previously encountered toxicity, optimization of acceptable level of production, optimization to have better suitability for the route of administration</li>    <li>Characterization of identity and properties (e.g., cell phenotype, aggregation, epitope mapping, glycosylation or other post-translational modification, number of unpaired cysteines, oxidation, deamination, isomerization, proteolytic sites, sequences, viscosity, stability)</li>    <li>Assessment of in vitro activities (e.g., affinity, specificity, activity in cells, cellular uptake)</li>    <li>Assessment of in vivo pharmacology such as determination of dose range, dosing regimen, route of administration, and ideal time and duration of treatment. This includes but is not limited to assessment of efficacy and/or target engagement, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic measurements (including pharmacodynamic biomarkers), relationships among pharmacokinetics, target engagement and/or pharmacodynamic measurements, correlations between in vitro and in vivo activities, bioavailability at the site of action such as blood-brain-barrier penetration</li>    <li>Studies to support independent replication, appropriate powering, or an assessment of efficacy in additional animal models if necessary to gain higher level of confidence for translatability of the discovery to the clinic, along with the model in which the leads were shown to have efficacy. However, these activities are restricted to the purpose of supporting the proposed development of a therapy and should be a limited portion of the application</li>    <li>Evaluation of metabolism</li>    <li>Optimization of production (e.g., expression levels, purification yield, purity, yield of vector or cells)</li>    <li>Process development for scale-up manufacturing</li>    <li>Stage-appropriate bioanalytical assay development and optimization in compliance with regulatory requirements</li>    <li>Optimization of delivery systems and special formulations (such as slow release, liposomes, nanoparticles, etc.)</li>    <li>Development of regulatory strategy and stage-appropriate interactions with regulatory agency</li>    <li>Validation of target engagement assays, including experiments using human specimens, are within the scope of this FOA. However, these activities are restricted to the purpose of supporting the proposed development of a therapy.</li>    </ul>    <p>To minimize potential funding gaps between the NINDS CREATE Bio Optimization and Development Tracks, applicants of this Optimization Track FOA may propose limited initial work for the Development Track, such as starting to identify species for toxicology study or preliminary safety evaluations, preliminary biodistribution study. &nbsp;These transitioning activities are generally restricted to the last year of Optimization Track applications. Awardees are encouraged to apply to the Development Track FOA as soon as they are eligible while finalizing studies in the Optimization Track.</p>    <p><strong><em>Examples of Activities Inappropriate for this FOA include:</em></strong></p>    <ul>    <li>Developing animal models</li>    <li>Basic research of disease mechanisms</li>    <li>Early activities such as target identification and validation</li>    <li>Development of risk, detection, diagnostic, prognostic, efficacy prediction biomarkers.&nbsp; (NINDS recognizes that target engagement markers developed may evolve into predictive markers for making clinical decisions for treatment trials, but it is not the intent of this FOA to support development of predictive biomarkers.)</li>    <li>Manufacture of therapeutics for clinical trials</li>    <li>Clinical research and clinical trials involving human subjects, except those in scope using human samples to validate target engagement assays</li>    <li>Stand-alone studies to identify, validate, or qualify a target engagement marker and other bioanalytical assays</li>    <li>Activities that are supported through the NINDS CREATE Bio Development Track FOA with the exception of the transitioning activities designed to enable easy transition from the Optimization to the Development Track as described above.</li>    </ul>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>C. Milestones</strong></div>    <p>Milestones are quantifiable goals that are used to monitor project progress and facilitate dialogue and go/no-go decision making between program staff and the project team to effectively manage the project. NINDS recognizes time sensitivity in developing therapeutics for patients who urgently need new or better treatment.</p>    <p>Prior to funding an application, NINDS Program staff will contact the applicant to discuss the proposed milestones and any changes suggested by the NINDS review panel or NINDS Program staff.&nbsp; A final set of approved milestones will be specified in the Notice of Award.</p>    <p>Progress towards achievement of the final set of milestones will be evaluated by NINDS Program staff.&nbsp; NINDS Program staff may seek advice from independent consults with relevant expertise as necessary. &nbsp;If justified, future year milestones may be revised based on data and information obtained during the previous year. Funding for the project may be discontinued if milestones are not met. &nbsp;In addition to milestones, the decision regarding continued funding will also be based on the overall robustness of the entire data package that adequately allows an interpretation of the results (regardless if they have been captured in the milestones), overall progress, NINDS portfolio balance and program priorities, competitive landscape, and availability of funds.</p>    <p>NINDS emphasizes the importance of the rigor and reproducibility of experimental results.&nbsp; In some cases, conducting additional critical experiments will be important for NINDS to have confidence in making a funding decision. &nbsp;Therefore, NINDS Program staff, in consultation with the PD/PI, may add experiments that need to be conducted prior to or during the award as additional milestone(s). In most cases, these studies will be supported by additional funds from NINDS.</p>    <p>If the research contains parallel activities from an independently funded, ongoing study prior to or during the funding period, it should be noted with appropriate milestones.</p>    <p>Applicants are encouraged to read examples of milestones (<a href=""https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Funding/Apply-Funding/Application-Support-Library/CREATE-Bio-Examples-Milestones"">CREATE Bio Example Milestones</a>), and see a summary chart of a milestone timeline (<a href=""https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Funding/Apply-Funding/Application-Support-Library/CREATE-Bio-Sample-Timeline"">CREATE Bio Milestone Summary and Timeline</a>).</p>    <p>For details see the Application and Submission section below.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>D. Intellectual Property (IP)</strong></div>    <p>Since the ultimate goal of the CREATE Bio program is to bring new therapies to the market/patients, the program strongly encourages the awardees and/or their collaborators to obtain and retain any IP developed around the therapy during the project period (see instructions on attachment of letters to address IP issues in Section IV).&nbsp;&nbsp; In compliance with the Bayh-Dole Act, this program is structured so that the awardee institution can elect to retain title to inventions; not withstanding the rights reserved by the U.S. Government if title is elected by awardee institution, NINDS/NIH does not intend to hold any additional IP rights for therapies developed in this program.&nbsp; NIH policy requires invention reporting in&nbsp;<a href=""https://public.era.nih.gov/iedison"">iEdison</a>.&nbsp; Patents should also include a reference to NIH funding support by including the grant/cooperative agreement number in the patent.&nbsp; The awardee institution will take responsibility for patent filings, prosecution, and maintenance as well as licensing efforts toward eventual commercialization.&nbsp; PDs/PIs are expected to work closely with their institutional technology transfer/business development officials to ensure that appropriate technology transfer agreements, patent filings, and all other necessary IP arrangements are completed in a timely manner and that commercialization plans are developed and updated over the course of the project.&nbsp; Award recipients are encouraged to identify and foster relationships with potential licensing and commercialization partners early in the therapy development process. For rare or ultra-rare diseases where commercialization may be challenging, applicants are encouraged to discuss alternative strategies with NINDS Scientific/Research staff to get further guidance.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>E. Pre-application Consultation</strong></div>    <p>As an U44 cooperative agreement, implementation will involve the participation of NINDS Program staff in the planning and execution of the therapy-directed projects.&nbsp; Applicants and their multidisciplinary team are strongly encouraged to consult with NINDS Scientific/Research staff when planning an application.

These studies have helped advance fundamental insights into key lifestyle and genetic determinants of heart, lung, blood and sleep related health outcomes. NHLBI recognizes that observational cohorts are a valuable resource that benefit the entire health community. The goal of this program is to support the necessary infrastructure to continue ongoing longitudinal follow-up of study participants and to conduct a basic content exam and/or data collection cycle. By creating stable funding for cohort infrastructure and maintenance for an extended project period (up to seven years), it is anticipated that the research community will have greater freedom to submit investigator-initiated grant applications proposing additional data collection content that address innovative hypotheses. This FOA provides an opportunity for NHLBI to support cohort infrastructure as a platform for investigator-initiated innovative hypotheses and is being implemented in response to one of the recommendations of a working group comprised of members from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council and Board of External Experts in 2013 to implement a competitive peer review&ndash;based model for its portfolio of large epidemiologic and population studies (Roger VL et al,&nbsp;<em>Am J. Epidemiol 2015;181(6):363-367</em>).</p>    <p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>    <p>The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to support reseach projects that will provide follow-up data collection and study maintenance activities of existing epidemiology cohorts that are prospectively following at least 2,000 participants. Through this FOA, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) will support the planning and operation of a basic content exam or data collection cycle, and ascertainment and/or adjudication of events of clinical significance. The primary goal of this FOA is to maintain and maximize investments in existing prospective cohorts by supporting the identification of relevant outcome events and the infrastructure needed to facilitate new innovative research opportunities.</p>    <p class=""Bullet""><strong>Scope</strong></p>    <p class=""Bullet""><em>Types of Eligible Cohorts</em></p>    <p class=""Bullet"">Eligible cohorts must be prospectively following at least 2,000 participants and must be established to assess a broad array of exposures such as the confluence of diet, exercise, therapies, environmental, behavioral, and biological factors for development and/or progression of outcomes of interest. The cohort does not have to be currently funded by the NHLBI. However, planned activities to maintain the cohort must be relevant to NHLBI's mission to advance knowledge, methods, or prevention strategies in heart, lung, blood, or sleep diseases or disorders. Support through this FOA is intended for the following cohort types:</p>    <ul>    <li>Epidemiological cohorts predominantly focused on U.S. populations and based on defined population groups (e.g., racial or ethnic minorities, geographic area, adolescents, families) or disease/disorder focused (e.g., participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, adolescents with asthma, participants with cardiomyopathies, participants with hemoglobin disorders).</li>    <li>Cohorts established through either solicited or unsolicited awards, or through independent funding sources (e.g., industry, foundations).</li>    </ul>    <p><em>Basic Content Exam and/or Data Collection Cycle</em></p>    <p>This FOA will support applications that propose to provide a basic content exam and/or data collection cycle that can serve as a foundation for concurrent innovative research hypotheses. The basic content exam and/or data collection components will ultimately depend on the nature of the prospective cohort. Potential content would include data elements&nbsp;<em>fundamental to study objectives</em>, such as demographics, anthropometry, blood pressure, smoking history, clinical characteristics and basic diagnostic information (e.g., functional status), co-morbidities (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and lifestyle factors (e.g., body mass index, smoking, alcohol use).</p>    <p><em>Supported Research Activities</em></p>    <p>In addition to the basic content exam and/or data collection cycle, supported study activities conducted within the scope of this FOA include, but are not limited to:</p>    <ul>    <li>Retention and follow-up (active and/or passive) of enrolled participants</li>    <li>Ascertainment of events of clinical significance through medical record review or vital records searches</li>    <li>Activities related to the efficient planning and operation of cohorts to maximize their potential to respond to future scientific needs</li>    <li>Maintenance of data and biospecimen repositories, study operations, and facilitation of collaborations among investigators</li>    <li>Biospecimen collection, storage, and management</li>    <li>Data management, and administrative and communication tasks</li>    </ul>    <p><strong>Estimated Study Timeline</strong></p>    <p>Awards made under this FOA have the opportunity for extended project periods (up to seven years) to accommodate the grant submission and funding process for ancillary content. The estimated timeline is provided below. The estimated timeline does not specifically address ongoing activities such as continued follow-up involving participant contact, cohort surveillance to capture events of clinical significance, or maintenance and distribution of data and stored biospecimens as these activities take place throughout the project period.</p>    <p class=""Bullet""><em>Year One and Two</em></p>    <p class=""Bullet"">Following notification of award, the first year will be dedicated to protocol and consent document development for the basic content exam/data collection cycle, finalization of the protocol and consent documents, submission and approval of protocol and consent documents to the IRB(s), site staff preparation, and site facility preparedness. To accommodate the NIH grant submission process for novel, ancillary content (described below under ancillary research), approximately 18 months will be allotted to allow ancillary content to be approved through internal study processes and provide the scientific community sufficient time to prepare grant applications and, if needed, resubmission applications. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p class=""Bullet""><em>Year Three through Five</em></p>    <p class=""Bullet"">Examination of the cohort may take one to three years depending on the size and nature of the cohort. It is anticipated that the basic content exam/data collection cycle, along with collection of approved content from ancillary studies, will begin during year three.</p>    <p class=""Bullet""><em>Year Six</em></p>    <p class=""Bullet"">It is anticipated that during year six of the funding cycle, quality control and cleaning of the basic content exam/data collection cycle as well as quality control, cleaning, and integration of ancillary content into main study databases will take place.</p>    <p class=""Bullet""><em>Year Seven&nbsp;</em></p>    <p class=""Bullet"">The value of cohort studies builds over time with accumulation of longer surveillance for clinical outcomes, integration of novel exam components and expansion of investigator collaboration. The proposed timeline will allow investigators a year or more (maximum study years six and seven) to demonstrate productivity and justification for continuing the study prior to submitting a renewal application. Epidemiological cohort studies are typically long-running studies, and the extended project period will prevent disassembly of study infrastructure and provide for continued cohort surveillance during the final year of the award.</p>    <p><strong>Ancillary Research</strong></p>    <p>As an adjunct to the activities supported under this FOA, &nbsp;NHLBI intends to publish a Notice(s) in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/funding/index.htm"">NIH Guide</a>&nbsp;announcing approximate dates of the basicexamination and/or data collection cycle&nbsp;<em>for each cohort</em>&nbsp;funded under this FOA, thereby announcing an opportunity for researchers to submit investigator-initiated grant applications proposing additional exam components that address innovative hypotheses.</p>; <div class=""heading2""><strong>Award Information</strong></div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Funding Instrument</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>Cooperative Agreement: A support mechanism used when there will be substantial Federal scientific or programmatic involvement.

A rich body of knowledge exists regarding the systems-level coordination of temporal patterns of electrophysiological activity in the brain.&nbsp;One key principle that has emerged from basic systems-level neuroscience is that brain rhythms appear to be necessary for normal cognition, including phase-amplitude coupling of slow and fast rhythms, spike-phase correlations such as hippocampal theta precession, and the re-activation of previously experienced neural activity on specific oscillatory frequencies. On the clinical side, cognitive symptoms in particular are among the least tractable and most disabling problems across a wide range of brain disorders, including autism and schizophrenia, because they affect the ability to live independently, such as holding a job and managing a bank account.&nbsp;Almost none of the existing treatments for neuropsychiatric illnesses were developed for the purpose of modulating systems-level coordination of neural activity, yet this is the level at which brain processes such as attention, memory, and social processing emerge.&nbsp;Even for medications that are based on a rational understanding of single-gene disorders, such as Fragile X, Rett, or Angelman syndromes, it has been surprisingly difficult to ameliorate cognitive, affective, or social symptoms in patients with these disorders.&nbsp;However, these medications act at the molecular level, and they might not have a useful effect at the systems level.&nbsp; Therefore, it might be advantageous and even necessary to begin to address cognitive, affective, and social domains of function with a greater consideration of the systems-level electrophysiological patterns, and to test whether modulating these patterns can improve function. The key idea is to evaluate any intervention, whether pharmacological or not, at the systems level rather than exclusively at the molecular level.&nbsp; Evaluating interventions at the systems level might be helpful regardless of whether the interventions themselves are at the genetic, molecular, or cellular level via pharmacology or gene editing, or whether the intervention is at the systems level such as electrical or magnetic stimulation.&nbsp;The purpose of this FOA is to seek applications that use active manipulations to address at least one, and ideally more, of the following points: (1) in animals or humans, determine which parameters of neural coordination, when manipulated in isolation, improve particular aspects of cognitive, affective, or social processing;&nbsp;(2) in animals or humans, determine how particular abnormalities at the cellular or molecular level, such as specific receptor dysfunction, affect the coordination of electrophysiological patterns during behavior; (3) determine whether in vivo, systems-level electrophysiological changes in behaving animals predict analogous electrophysiological and cognitive improvements in normal humans or clinical populations; and (4) use systems-level computational modeling to develop a principled understanding of the function and mechanisms by which oscillatory and other electrophysiological patterns unfold across the brain (cortically and subcortically) to impact cognitive, affective, or social processing.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p>Cognition appears to emerge at the level of populations of neurons, with information represented and organized as action potentials and network events that are temporally coordinated across brain areas.&nbsp; For example, there have been notable advances in our basic understanding of the role of local field potential (LFP) oscillations and large-scale coordination of neural networks in learning and memory.&nbsp; In rodents, particular patterns of temporal dynamics have been shown to proportionally improve or worsen working memory, and particular LFP oscillatory bands predict episodic/relational learning.&nbsp; Theta phase precession is another well-known precise temporal code that might be required for optimal cognition, and the precise reactivation of neural activity during hippocampal sharp wave ripples is also a temporally coordinated representation that might be necessary for memory consolidation or decision making.&nbsp;</p>    <p>From a disease standpoint, electrophysiological aberrations exist in many brain disorders, and recent findings suggest that modulating electrophysiological patterns could potentially have therapeutic benefit.&nbsp;In schizophrenia, findings have suggested that systems-level electrophysiological endophenotypes are modifiable and that such modifications have the potential to improve cognition.&nbsp; In autism, the modest amounts of electrophysiological data that exist in patients and model organisms suggest that this disorder also has disruptions in temporal coordination of neural signals, and that electrophysiological patterns at the level of neural populations might represent an intermediate, modifiable phenotype. Furthermore, rationally-developed pharmacological interventions are being tested for autism spectrum disorders, whose effect on temporal dynamics of electrophysiological patterns might be instructive to examine, especially if the treatments are directed at the cognitive impairments that lead to significant functional deficits for some patients.&nbsp;</p>    <p>These basic and translational findings should be expanded to better understand the brain algorithms that implement learning, memory consolidation, attention, reasoning, affect regulation, and social interactions. The patterns of neural coordination can also be brought to bear on areas of translation such as pre-clinical target validation studies in animals or, in humans, as treatment effectiveness biomarkers or as stratification variables. Work in non-human primates is also highly encouraged, as it would provide a bridge between rodent and human work with regard to neuroanatomy and cognitive capabilities.</p>    <p>The underlying premise of this funding opportunity is that cognitive, affective, and social dysfunction may result in part from compromised systems-level electrophysiological patterns; that these patterns are necessary for normal brain function; and therefore, treatments whose goal is to improve these domains of function might be more effective if they improve the underlying aberrant electrophysiological patterns.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives</strong></div>    <p>Applications should address at least one, and ideally more, of the following topic areas:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p>Topic 1:&nbsp; Temporal dynamics of neural patterns that impact cognition, affect, or social behavior</p>    <p>In animals or humans, determine which aspects of temporal coordination of systems-level neural activity affect particular domains of function such as working memory, long-term memory, relational/spatial processing, attention, cognitive control, decision making, affect regulation, or social cognition. Projects should manipulate specific aspects of the electrophysiological patterns (e.g., the power of oscillatory frequencies during particular task periods, or the degree of phase-amplitude coupling of particular frequency pairs) to determine what parameters, if manipulated appropriately, might yield the most robust and reliable improvements in behavior. Active manipulations proposed in grant applications that address Topic 1 can consist of electrical or magnetic brain stimulation, optogenetics, pharmacological compounds including novel or existing medications if well justified, or other modalities. Novel interventions are encouraged if they might provide greater temporal and/or spatial resolution.&nbsp;It is expected that applications provide a strong scientific rationale for the specific biological intervention chosen, and why it is expected to selectively alter electrophysiological measures in a particular direction.&nbsp;All projects should include measures of neural activity at the systems level during awake behavior.</p>    <p>Topic 2:&nbsp; Understanding how molecular aberrations lead to systems-level discoordination</p>    <p>In animals or humans, understand how particular abnormalities at the cellular or molecular level, such as glutamate or GABA receptor dysfunction, affect the coordination of electrophysiological patterns during cognitive, affective, or social processing.&nbsp;Single-gene disorders in particular, such as Fragile X or Rett syndromes, might be a good opportunity to study such mechanistic questions in the context of systems level dynamics, but the case can also be made for neuropsychiatric disorders of more heterogeneous etiology. The emphasis can be on discovering ways to rescue the systems-level discoordination with either molecular/cellular interventions (e.g., pharmacology, genomic interventions), or with neurophysiology manipulations such as patterned electrical or optogenetic stimulation. The outcomes should be measured at both the systems electrophysiology level and at the behavioral level.</p>    <p>Topic 3:&nbsp; Animal-to-human translation</p>    <p>Determine whether the changes in neural coordination patterns that improve cognition in animals predict analogous electrophysiological and cognitive improvements in normal humans and/or clinical populations.&nbsp;A key goal is to understand the translational value of systems electrophysiology in pre-clinical models, to know whether an electrophysiological pattern identified in a relevant model system is predictive of a similarly aberrant pattern in patients, and whether the effects of any interventions in animals are predictive of their effects in humans.&nbsp;Another goal is to characterize aberrant electrophysiological patterns during cognition in clinical patients, although electrophysiological recordings in humans, if it does not have an active intervention, should be accompanied by parallel work in animals that includes active interventions.&nbsp;It is expected that, to the greatest extent possible, identical interventions (e.g., the same pharmacological compounds, or comparably patterned electrical stimulation in model animals and humans) and tasks (e.g., equivalent working memory tasks) will be used. A related question of interest is whether any existing or novel medications are able to modify neural coordination patterns, and whether this mediates any improvement in cognition, affect, or social interaction.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Topic 4:&nbsp; Computational modeling</p>    <p>Develop a biologically realistic computational model to allow a principled understanding of the algorithms and mechanisms by which neural coordination patterns across brain areas affect cognitive, affective, and social processing. The computational models can cross levels, such as from the biophysical level to systems-level emergent properties, and they can also be top-down, such as mathematically describing and manipulating higher-order parameters of oscillatory coordination in relation to information processing and behavioral output. Projects that address the topic of computational modeling should also include work in animals or in humans, provide testable predictions, and be closely informed by the results.</p>    <p>There are two goals with this Topic.&nbsp;One goal is to reach a mechanistic understanding of how rhythmic patterns support information processing in the brain in the service of cognitive, affective, and social processing, and, relatedly, what algorithms are being implemented in the brain for each type of processing, including, but not limited to, spatial navigation, non-spatial relational processing (e.g., transitive inference), manipulation of items in working memory, social interaction, emotion regulation, decision making, and other cognitive domains of function.&nbsp;A second goal is to understand how modifying a neural pattern in one region of the network affects the patterns in other brain regions. This work can include modeling how brain stimulation at the scalp might affect oscillations and information processing subcortically (e.g., in the hippocampus), or in other cortical areas.&nbsp;The purpose of this is to understand network-level ramifications of local changes in oscillatory dynamics.&nbsp; Applications can address one or more of these goals.</p>    <p>Examples of research topics include, but are not limited to:</p>    <p>An example of Topic 1 would be to conduct electrophysiological recordings in an animal relevant to neuropsychiatric disease during a spatial working memory task and to determine what systems-level aspects of the electrophysiological patterns could be modified to improve task behavior.&nbsp;The goal could be, for example, to examine whether theta precession, phase-amplitude coupling, sharp-wave ripples, or other neural patterns are aberrant. Are there particular patterns of electrical stimulation that would improve theta precession, and would this improve spatial as well as non-spatial relational processing? What is the mechanism by which the changed neural pattern improves behavior?&nbsp;Methods for altering neural patterns could include pharmacological intervention, optogenetic methods, patterned electrical stimulation, or other methods, as long as the method allows for understanding what aspects of the temporal dynamics are the drivers of behavioral improvements, such as changes in amplitude of particular oscillatory frequencies, the co-modulation of particular frequencies, or other characteristics of oscillatory patterns and spike timing.</p>    <p>Another example of Topic 1 would be to use patterned brain stimulation to test whether higher-level cognition could be improved in tasks such as transitive inference.&nbsp;For example, could sharp wave ripples be triggered to occur artificially, and might this improve an aspect of cognition?&nbsp;Can the fidelity of replay be improved?&nbsp;Work of this type would be especially encouraged in nonhuman primates because of more relevant brain anatomy and the possibility for more complex behavioral tasks.</p>    <p>An example of Topic 2 would be to determine how over-activation of metabotropic glutamate signaling, or GABA receptor dysfunction in FMR1 knockout animals leads to particular changes in neural patterns and cognition, and which interventions could correct the systems-level neural coordination during an otherwise impaired behavior.</p>    <p>An example of Topic 3 would be to test whether changes in neural coordination patterns in rodent models of relevant phenotypes predict similar intervention-induced changes in patients' EEG signals, during an equivalent behavioral task. The interventions in patients could be noninvasive brain stimulation (e.g., patterned transcranial magnetic or electrical stimulation) or medications.&nbsp; This type of work should also test whether the cognitive/behavioral improvements seen in rodents also predict improvements in patients.&nbsp;</p>    <p>An example of Topic 4 would be to develop a biologically-realistic, computational model for predicting effects of noninvasive brain stimulation on particular frequencies of cortical and subcortical oscillations and how they interact across trial time and across brain areas.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Another example of Topic 4 might be to model and experimentally test the effects of interneuron signaling on systems-level temporal dynamics.&nbsp;</p>    <p>In addition to addressing at least one of the four topic areas listed above, all applications under this FOA are also expected to fulfill the following requirements:</p>    <p>All projects should employ active manipulations in awake, behaving vertebrate animals. The manipulations can consist of electrical or magnetic brain stimulation, optogenetics, genome editing, pharmacological compounds including existing or novel medications, or other modalities, but they cannot consist solely of behavioral manipulations.&nbsp;Biological manipulations can be tested in conjunction with behavioral training, such as brain stimulation protocols to augment the effectiveness of applied behavioral analysis therapy in autism. In general, novel interventions are encouraged.&nbsp;</p>    <p>All projects should provide a strong scientific rationale for the specific biological intervention chosen (pharmacological or otherwise), in particular whether the intervention can be expected to selectively alter a well-defined aspect of a systems-level temporal pattern in a particular direction (e.g., increasing the power of a specific oscillatory frequency).&nbsp;</p>    <p>All projects are expected to include in vivo, electrophysiological systems-level measures during behavior in each species.&nbsp;Computational/analytic work in particular is expected to reciprocally and iteratively interact closely with experimental work.&nbsp;The use of any non-mammalian species should be clearly justified, providing strong evidence that electrophysiological patterns during cognition are likely to generalize from animals to humans.&nbsp;</p>    <p>EEG work is expected to include spectral analyses.&nbsp;</p>    <p>All projects are expected to employ recording methods that detect neural activity directly, without relying on blood flow measures.&nbsp;All recording methods are expected to have the appropriate temporal resolution to address temporal dynamics of coordinated neural activity during cognition.</p>    <p>This FOA seeks to generate a mechanistic understanding of what aspects of neural coordination and patterning can be modified to improve cognitive, affective, and social processing.&nbsp;A related goal is the identification of reliable and sensitive electrophysiological signatures that would facilitate screening novel interventions to understand how they affect particular electrophysiological patterns, and what clinical population might have a deficit in particular patterns.&nbsp;Efforts from projects responding to this FOA should eventually support the development of pharmacological, electrical, magnetic, or other types of interventions that can enhance cognitive, affective, or social processing sufficiently to improve real-life functioning for patients. As such, grant applications for clinical trials should not be submitted under this FOA.&nbsp;For a listing of NIMH FOAs that support Clinical Trials, please refer to the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas/index.shtml"">Clinical Trials Funding Opportunity Announcements</a>&nbsp;webpage.</p>    <p>All applicants are encouraged to contact Scientific/Research staff at NIMH before submitting a grant application.</p>    <p>Protection of Human Subjects: Applications with data collection plans that involve multiple respondent groups (e.g., clients/patients, therapists/providers, supervisors, administrators) should address provisions for human subject protections and consenting procedures for all participant groups, accordingly.

The NIHR is now also joining as a partner, under Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) funding. The four partner agencies share the view that in order to have maximum impact on health we need to work together to provide evidence of the best, and most appropriate interventions to improve health in LMIC settings.&nbsp; Pooling resources brings the necessary funds and experience together to achieve implementable results which address health problems affecting low and middle income countries. Together we will fund up to &pound;20 million for the eighth call to be launched under the joint global health trials partnership.</p>    <p><strong>Objectives and remit</strong></p>    <p>The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding for the best proposals to generate new knowledge about interventions that will contribute to the improvement of health in low and middle income countries.</p>    <p>The scheme will give priority to proposals that are likely to produce implementable results and that are designed to address the major causes of mortality or morbidity in low and middle income countries. For call 8, the joint funders would like to stress that applications must engage with the potential of research for future implementation and impact for policy. Stakeholders, such as policy makers, should be engaged throughout the research process in order to ensure trial results are implementable, scalable and in line with policy needs.</p>    <p>The scheme is open to the best proposals which address any major health related problem affecting low and middle income countries, particularly those that affect the most vulnerable populations.&nbsp; Although the breadth of the scheme is deliberately wide, we particularly welcome proposals for research into chronic non-communicable diseases, including mental health, and reproductive, maternal and new born health.</p>    <p>The joint global health trials scheme is aimed at funding randomised controlled trials (RCTs), although other types of methodologies can be used alongside RCTs to explore implementation and operational issues. Nested studies to explore these issues and support future implementation are encouraged.</p>    <p>The scheme focuses on late-stage (equivalent to phase III/IV) clinical and health intervention trials that evaluate efficacy and effectiveness. We may consider Phase IIb trials of major relevance to the objectives of the call, but please contact the office to discuss this beforehand.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>The scope of the scheme includes, but is not limited to:</strong></p>    <ul>    <li>Behavioural interventions</li>    <li>Psychological therapies</li>    <li>Disease management</li>    <li>Drugs</li>    <li>Vaccines</li>    <li>Hygiene</li>    <li>Diagnostic strategies</li>    </ul>    <p><strong>*For call 8, the joint funders would like to highlight an interest in funding complex interventions delivered in community settings including primary health care.*</strong></p>    <p><strong>Geographical scope:</strong>&nbsp; Studies funded through this scheme should be based in countries with low or middle income economies.&nbsp; World Bank definitions of low and middle income economies can be found at&nbsp;<a class=""external link"" href=""http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/daclist.htm"" target=""_blank"">DAC List of ODA Recipients<span class=""hideLink"">opens in new window</span></a>. The scheme encourages Principal Investigators to apply from these countries.</p>    <p><strong>You can choose between two proposal types:</strong></p>    <ul>    <li>Global health trial research grants</li>    <li>Trial development grants.</li>    </ul>    <p>The scheme funds RCTs, innovative trial methodologies and adaptive designs are&nbsp; welcome.&nbsp;In all instances a clear justification for the chosen methodology must be provided and a clear reason for why the chosen trial design is likely to provide the most robust evidence to address the research question. Applicants are asked to clearly justify the proposed method for randomisation; any applications using sealed envelopes should be justified as to why this is the best option and any sources of bias identified.&nbsp;<strong>Proposers are encouraged to submit applications that contain complex and sometimes high risk methodologies where appropriate.</strong></p>    <p><strong>Issues to consider which would strengthen your proposal:</strong></p>    <ul>    <li>As the primary objective of this scheme is to develop and evaluate interventions with the potential for a significant impact on population health, applicants are encouraged to comment on the potential impact and broader applicability of the intervention beyond academic contributions.</li>    <li>Proposers are encouraged to include social science and health economics expertise to ensure that the interventions are appropriate, acceptable and feasible to their target populations and that any potential social, cultural and economic barriers to implementation are examined.</li>    <li>It is important that the results of research funded under this scheme have the potential to be implemented at scale.&nbsp; We therefore encourage applicants to include, where relevant, health systems, economics and implementation research in their proposals to provide lessons relevant to scale-up.</li>    <li>Strong partnership links policy makers and potential implementing partners in low and middle income countries will be important to the long-term impact of the research funded.&nbsp; This should be considered when applicants are preparing their consortia.</li>    <li>Proposed trials should, as far as it is practicable, be fully developed and costed before they are allowed to start. Applications for full trials that require preliminary data should consider applying for the development grant strand of the scheme.</li>    </ul>    <p>Support is conditional on the host institution being able to demonstrate that they are able to conduct the trial to the standards set out in the&nbsp;<a class=""internal link"" href=""https://www.mrc.ac.uk/documents/pdf/good-clinical-practice-in-clinical-trials/"">MRC guidelines for good clinical practice in clinical trials</a>. Under this scheme it is expected that the host institute will be the sponsor of the trial.&nbsp;Support will be conditional on all required ethical, legal and regulatory approvals being obtained before the trial commences.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The scheme is targeted at trials led by academic groups, and not at trials led by commercial companies or product development partnerships (PDPs). However, applications are welcome from investigators from academic institutions who wish to collaborate with commercial companies or PDPs. Academic-industry collaborations will be considered under the MRC Industry Collaboration Agreement (MICA) mechanism &ndash; please see the MRC website for more&nbsp;<a class=""internal link"" href=""https://www.mrc.ac.uk/innovation/mrc-industry-collaboration-agreement-mica/"">information</a>.&nbsp;</p>    <h3>Funding for development grant proposals<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>    <p>The scheme remains primarily a mechanism to support full trials.&nbsp; However, we recognise that preliminary work is often needed in order for applicants to develop innovative partnerships and trial proposals.</p>    <p>The aims of a trial development grant must be to address questions which need to be answered before a credible, competitive, full trial can be designed.&nbsp;Examples of work that a development grant can cover are:</p>    <ul>    <li>Studies to generate specific data that are needed to inform the trial design, such as to determine the sample size, outcome measures, recruitment strategy, follow-up strategy, appropriate monitoring activities and timings.&nbsp; Work to understand the likelihood of contamination within the trial e.g. in a cluster randomised trial, and how that contamination might be handled.</li>    <li>Work to inform the design of the trial intervention, for instance feasibility and acceptability issues in a public health intervention.&nbsp;</li>    <li>Trial development grant funding cannot be used in this scheme for drug, vaccine, device, diagnostic or other biomedical intervention development. This means that activities such as drug discovery research, preclinical and early phase 1 and 2 clinical studies are ineligible for funding through this scheme.&nbsp; However, it would be appropriate to use a trial development grant to address trial feasibility questions such as the best way to provide a particular drug within a specific context or population.</li>    </ul>    <p>Trial development grant holders will not be automatically awarded funds for a full trial upon completion of their development grant.&nbsp; If the Joint Global Health Trials partnership is still live by that point, they could submit an outline proposal to the main trial application route in open competition with all other applicants.&nbsp; If the partnership is not live anymore, potential applicants will need to investigate other potential funding sources either with the individual funders who fund the Joint Global Health Trials scheme, or elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>How to apply</strong></p>    <p>Applications will be submitted to and processed by MRC on behalf of the four partner agencies.</p>    <p><strong>There are two application types:</strong></p>    <ul>    <li>Global health trial research grants (two stage application process, decisions for invitation for full stage in December 2017, funding decision in June 2018)</li>    <li>Trial development grants (one stage application process, funding decision in December 2017)</li>    </ul>    <p><strong>Please see the guidance documents&nbsp;for further information on applying through either route.</strong></p>    <p><a class=""internal link"" href=""https://www.mrc.ac.uk/documents/pdf/jght-8-development-guidance/"">Development guidance</a><br /><a class=""internal link"" href=""https://www.mrc.ac.uk/documents/pdf/jght-8-outline-guidance/"">Outline guidance</a></p>    <p><strong>The MRC must receive your outline proposal by 16:00 British Summer Time on Thursday 14</strong>&nbsp;<strong>September 2017.</strong></p>    <p><strong>Funding available</strong></p>    <p>A total of up to &pound;20 million is available.&nbsp;This is expected to fund several full trial awards. Up to &pound;1 million of the total amount is expected to be spent on several trial development grants.</p>    <p>Successful trial proposals do not need to be large-multi-centre trials.&nbsp;Proposals will be evaluated on value for money and on whether the proposed scale of research is necessary and cost-effective for answering the research question.&nbsp;</p>    <h3>You may request support for:</h3>    <ul>    <li>All research costs that are attributable to the trial. For example, appropriate percentages of the investigators&rsquo; time, scientific, technical and administrative staff including statisticians, research nurses, trial managers etc., consumables, items of equipment, data /sample handling and archiving and travel</li>    <li>The cost of holding trial steering and data monitoring committees</li>    <li>Training and support for a trial manager</li>    </ul>    <p>Regulation, ethical review and liability may vary across different countries.&nbsp;Principal Investigators and proposed sponsors should ensure that they have adequately understood the feasibility and costs of participation of proposed international centres. For example, insurance arrangements will vary between countries and the sponsor (usually the host institution) is responsible for ensuring adequate arrangements are in place at each site.</p>    <p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p>    <h3>Principal Investigators</h3>    <p>This scheme is open to Principal Investigators who are employed by eligible institutions based in low or middle income countries (LMIC) where the research work will take place and to Principal Investigators who are employed by an eligible UK institution. Eligible UK institutions include UK Higher Education Institutions, Research Council institutes, and eligible Independent Research Organisations (IROs).&nbsp;All IROs listed on the&nbsp;<a class=""link external"" href=""https://www.mrc.ac.uk/links/research-councils-uk/"">Research Councils UK website</a>.</p>    <p>For researchers based in LMICs, eligible institutions include higher education institutions and non-profit research institutions.&nbsp;If the application is submitted by an LMIC organisation, the primary headquarters of that organisation must be in one of the LMIC countries where the trial will take place.&nbsp;This means that the institution sponsoring a PI must be legally registered in the UK or in a LMIC and the PI must be employed by the institution that is hosting the research</p>    <p>Research Institutions based outside the UK will be asked to complete additional eligibility and financial checks before an award is offered, and awards will be dependent on satisfactory completion of those checks and on-going monitoring.</p>    <p>MRC units and institutes can apply to this call; usual rules for funding grants to MRC units and institutes will apply.&nbsp; If you are based at an MRC unit or institute please contact your local MRC research support office for further information.</p>    <p>It is not permitted for the same person to be a Principal Investigator on more than two proposals submitted to this call.</p>    <h3>Co-applicants and collaborators</h3>    <p>The nature of this scheme means that we would expect applications to be predominantly based in LMIC.&nbsp;Funding for co-applicants and collaborators in other regions can be requested, but we would expect that the majority of funds would support the costs in the low or middle income country where the trial will be conducted. Investigators employed by an institution in a high income country outside the UK cannot be a Principal Investigator on a proposal, but can be a Co-investigator.</p>    <h3>Resubmissions</h3>    <p>We are not able to accept resubmissions of proposals that have already been considered under this scheme.&nbsp;If you have substantially changed a previous proposal and wish to discuss whether it might be eligible, please contact&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:JGHT@headoffice.mrc.ac.uk"">JGHT@headoffice.mrc.ac.uk</a>.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Evaluation process</strong></p>    <p>Applications will be considered by an expert panel convened specifically for this scheme jointly agreed by MRC, DFID, the Wellcome Trust and NIHR.&nbsp;Additional scientific experts will be invited to provide written comments if the funders and/or panel chair deem this necessary.</p>    <p>The panel&rsquo;s decision will be final and will not be open to appeal.

However, the scope of some scientific problems is beyond the capabilities of a small group of investigators. Such complex and challenging research questions benefit from the integrated efforts of teams of research laboratories employing complementary approaches and having diverse areas of intellectual and technical expertise, and the necessary resources to accomplish a unified scientific goal. Such team-based efforts can produce convergent, lasting scientific benefits with high impact, such as the creation of new disciplines of study, resolution of long standing or intractable problems, or definition of new areas that challenge current paradigms.</p>    <p>This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) encourages Collaborative Program Grant applications from institutions/organizations that propose to conduct research to address complex and challenging biomedical problems, important for the mission of NIGMS, through deeply integrated, multidisciplinary research teams. The Collaborative Program Grant is designed to support research in which funding a team of interdependent investigators offers significant advantages over support of individual research project grants. Applications should address critical issues and be sufficiently challenging, ambitious, and innovative that objectives could not be achieved by individual investigators.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p>Recent reports (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.teamsciencetoolkit.cancer.gov/public/TSResourceBiblio.aspx?tid=3&amp;rid=3253"">enhancing the effectiveness of team science</a>) have evaluated the benefits of a team science approach to scientific inquiry, and the need to create flexible funding opportunities that enable interdisciplinary research teams to accomplish goals that could not be achieved individually.&nbsp;<a name=""_Hlk486226713""></a>The Collaborative Program Grant draws on our past experience and is designed to improve support for interdisciplinary collaborative research across different scientific domains.&nbsp;<a name=""_Hlk486417491""></a>We also anticipate that these grants will enhance the diversity and interdisciplinarity of participating investigators, and may encourage early stage investigators (ESIs) to initiate short-term, complementary pilot studies that enrich the team's program objectives.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Scope of Research</strong></div>    <p>Successful Collaborative Program Grant applications will bring together scientists to apply complementary approaches to work on an important and well-defined problem. Applications may address any area of science within the NIGMS mission, which is to support basic research that increases understanding of biological processes at a range of levels, from molecules and cells to tissues, whole organisms and populations. NIGMS also supports research in a limited number of clinical areas that affect multiple organ systems (see&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nigms.nih.gov/about/overview/pages/default.aspx"">here</a>&nbsp;for scientific areas supported by NIGMS). Truly new interdisciplinary ideas for approaching significant biological problems are encouraged. Applications that bridge the research interests of more than one NIGMS division are also encouraged, but must remain within the scope of the NIGMS mission. Consultation with NIGMS staff (see below) prior to preparing an application is strongly encouraged.</p>    <p>Applications for smaller projects with one or two PD/PIs should consider submitting a multi-PD/PI application to the ""NIH Research Project Grant (Parent R01)"" FOA (see the&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/parent_announcements.htm"">Parent Announcement website</a>&nbsp;for the current issuance of this FOA). Applications that are mainly focused on the creation, expansion, and/or maintenance of community resources, or on infrastructure development are not appropriate for this FOA. Although Collaborative Program Grants may include some technology development, applications with a central focus on the creation of new technologies would not be considered for funding as a Collaborative Program Grant and are more appropriate for other NIGMS mechanisms for funding technology&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nigms.nih.gov/about/overview/BBCB/biomedicaltechnology/Pages/technologydevelopment.aspx"">research</a>and&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-17-316.html"">resources</a>.</p>    <p>Applications that employ specific cells or tissues to address a fundamental biomedical question are appropriate. However, applications that focus solely on a specific organ or disease state and that are within the mission areas of other NIH Institutes and Centers would not be appropriate for this FOA. All clinical research must be completely within the context of NIGMS clinical areas (anesthesiology and peri-operative pain; clinical pharmacology; sepsis; trauma, burn injury and wound healing). Finally, NIH-defined clinical trials are not allowed.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Program Organization</strong></div>    <p>Applications submitted to this FOA are expected to propose a single, well-integrated research plan of sufficient scope, complexity, and impact to justify the investment of significant resources. Applicants are expected to describe a cohesive program with a single set of specific aims sufficient to accomplish program objectives that can be achieved within a maximum of ten years (one five-year program with one competitive five-year renewal). Program objectives that are unlikely to be achieved within ten years are not appropriate for this FOA.</p>    <p>Applications should be sufficiently challenging, ambitious, and innovative that the proposed research cannot be achieved by a single investigator or small group of investigators. Therefore, a multiple PD/PI application is required and applications must include a minimum of three and a maximum of six PD/PIs who are all necessary to provide sufficient research capacity and the relevant expertise to address the proposed scientific problem. Applications that propose extrapolations of a single line of research or propose parallel but independent advancement of different areas are not appropriate for this FOA.</p>    <p>Applicant teams should be sufficiently nimble to provide new knowledge and techniques mid-stream that might be required to tackle unsolved challenges and achieve program objectives. Therefore, proposed approaches can be complemented by adding new pilot studies led by ESIs.</p>    <div class=""heading4"">Team Management and Optional Activities</div>    <p>Studies of team science have highlighted the need for effective management structures to achieve program goals. These structures grow in importance as the team size increases. Many resources exist to aid in developing effective team-based programs (see e.g., the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.teamsciencetoolkit.cancer.gov/public/Home.aspx"">NCI Team Science Toolkit</a>). In addition to the required multiple PD/PI leadership plan, applications are expected to develop a comprehensive team management plan that addresses the following points:</p>    <ul>    <li>Appropriate organizational structure and team composition</li>    <li>Shared leadership, contributions and distributed responsibility for decision making</li>    <li>Resource allocation</li>    <li>Plans for professional development</li>    <li>Conflict resolution</li>    </ul>    <p>If teams include individuals from widely divergent scientific backgrounds, applicants may wish to address how they will develop trust and a shared vision, as well as how shared responsibilities, interpersonal interactions and professional credit will be managed. Additionally, applicants may want to consider a scientific project manager or program coordinator as part of the management plan.</p>    <p>Collaborative Program Grant applications may propose optional activities to support ESIs through a program of exploratory pilot study projects. If applicable, the exploratory pilots must start after the first year of the award and propose new approaches that are within the original scope of the grant. For an NIH definition of ESI please refer to the&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/new_investigators/investigator_policies_faqs.htm#2650"">&nbsp;New Investigator Policy</a>. If the application includes pilot studies directed by ESIs, plans must be included for selecting the projects and for leveraging existing resources for appropriate mentoring, including the effective conduct of multidisciplinary team science, as described in&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-17-340.html#_Instructions_for_Application"">Part 2. Section IV.2</a>. An expectation for any successful pilot projects program would be that it would lead to funding independence for the participating ESIs. This will be a criterion in a subsequent Renewal application to evaluate the effectiveness of the pilot program in meeting this goal. Note that pilot studies are an optional activity, are not required, and, if requested, must be extremely well justified.</p>    <div class=""heading4"">Prior Consultation with IC staff</div>    <p>NIGMS intends to fund a limited number of applications. Therefore, consultation with relevant staff at least 10 weeks prior to the application due date is strongly encouraged. Once applicants have identified overall program objectives and PD/PI participants, NIGMS staff may be able to advise applicants whether the proposed research strategy meets the goals and mission of the Institute, whether it addresses one or more high priority research areas, and whether it is appropriate for a collaborative team program.&nbsp;<a name=""_Hlk486434855""></a>A collaborative program that is closely related to the goal of a PD/PIs' existing NIGMS-funded research might require that funding be relinquished to avoid overlap.&nbsp;Institute staff will not evaluate the technical and scientific merit of the proposed program in advance; technical and scientific merit will be determined during peer review using the review criteria indicated in this FOA. During the consultation phase, if the proposed research strategy does not meet NIGMS' programmatic needs or is not appropriate as a Collaborative Program Grant, applicants will be encouraged to consider other funding opportunities.</p>; <div class=""heading2""><strong>Award Information</strong></div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Funding Instrument</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>Grant: A support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Application Types Allowed</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>New&nbsp;<br />Resubmission</p>    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11116"">OER Glossary</a>&nbsp;and the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide provide details on these application types.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Clinical Trial?</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>Not Allowed: Only accepting applications that do not propose clinical trials</p>    <p><a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=82370"">Need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?</a></p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Funds Available and Anticipated Number of Awards</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>The number of awards is contingent upon NIH appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications</p>    <p>NIGMS anticipates supporting no more than 4-6 awards, corresponding to a total of $10,000,000 (total costs), for fiscal year 2019.

The proposed research projects are expected to focus on the development of highly-innovative technologies that improve molecular and/or cellular analysis of cancer with a significant likelihood for either overcoming persistent challenges or obstacles or opening entirely new fields for cancer research or clinical care. Applications should specify quantifiable milestones relevant to both the development and commercialization of these technologies. This FOA complements the goals of the NCI's&nbsp;<a href=""https://innovation.cancer.gov/"">Innovative Molecular Analysis Technologies (IMAT) program</a>&nbsp;by facilitating the path towards technology commercialization. Prior participation in the IMAT Program is not required for eligibility for this FOA. Applications are expected to indicate the significant attributes and advantages of the proposed technology over currently available technologies and conventional approaches. Although this FOA is open only to SBCs, it is run in partnership with NCI's IMAT Program. The IMAT Program uses research project grant activity codes (R21, R33) and these FOAs are broadly open to all qualified investigators. Non-SBC affiliated investigators interested in the development of relevant technologies are encouraged to consider submitting grant applications to one of these IMAT FOAs (for information on specific IMAT FOAs, see&nbsp;<a href=""https://innovation.cancer.gov/"">https://innovation.cancer.gov</a>).</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p>The NCI IMAT program is aimed at supporting the early-stage development of highly innovative technologies relevant to cancer research, prevention, diagnosis and treatment, and epidemiology. Since 1998, the IMAT Program has facilitated the development of various tools and methods benefiting research and, ultimately, clinical oncological practice. The emphasis of the IMAT Program is on supporting the early-stage development and validation of disruptive, high-impact innovations&nbsp;<a name=""_Hlk487362788""></a>offering new capabilities for basic through clinical cancer researchers.</p>    <p>The NCI recognizes the need for support in translating emerging analytical technologies into commercially available products and services. To facilitate commercial development of promising technologies and thereby widespread adoption of enabling new tools for cancer research, this FOA aims to fill a funding gap for those SBCs that need to perform further development and validation of a commercially viable product or service. This FOA complements other initiatives (including those from the IMAT Program), by supporting efforts aimed at the transition of technological conceptual advances toward broadly available products/tools/services.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Scientific/Technical Scope of this FOA</strong></div>    <p>This FOA will support researchers at SBCs, who wish to develop and validate their innovative technologies in the context of commercial use. These technologies could have been invented, discovered, and/or initially developed with support from any funding source including, but not limited to, the NCI IMAT Program, or may be entirely new invention applications. As mentioned previously, although prior participation in the IMAT Program is not required for this FOA, technologies proposed for this FOA are expected to exhibit a high degree of innovation with transformative potential, or otherwise demonstrate clear advantages over currently available technologies as is required for applications to the IMAT Program. Prospective applicants are advised to visit the&nbsp;<a href=""http://innovation.cancer.gov/"">IMAT</a>&nbsp;website for more information about the program.</p>    <p><strong>Definition of ""Technologies""</strong>: In the context of this FOA, the term ""technologies"" encompasses novel techniques, materials, instrumentation, and devices that offer significant improvements in terms of novel types of cancer-relevant analyses, and/or greater resolution, specificity, and/or throughput relative to the currently available methods/tools. Projects in any area of cancer-related molecular or cellular analysis are encouraged, provided that the technology proposed meets the requirement for potential as a commercial product or service. Technologies may target atomic, molecular, sub-cellular, and cellular levels of detection and analyses.&nbsp; Highly-innovative platforms for sample preparation and/or processing, and for improved downstream analysis are also within the scope of this FOA. This further includes technologies that offer a novel means for assessing general analyte quality to determine sample fitness-for-purpose for a known analytical platform. The proposed technology and application must correspond to an important unmet need relevant to cancer research and/or clinical aspects. Given the FOA's emphasis on commercial development, these technologies (for both Phase I and Phase II applications) must have a strong potential for commercial success.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>For Phase I projects</strong>, preliminary data are strongly encouraged but not required. If preliminary data are not available, Phase I projects must be based on rigorous scientific rationale. Phase I projects are expected to prove technical feasibility of the technology (and possibly generate a prototype, if appropriate) to a degree that is sufficient to support the use of the proposed technology in a cancer relevant application.</p>    <p><strong>For Phase II projects</strong>, the Phase I results should have already demonstrated technical feasibility of the invention. Phase II projects are expected to concentrate on further technology development and improvements, to address intellectual property protection (including work towards filing patent application if not done already) and preparation for regulatory steps, as applicable, that might be needed for a commercial application of the technology.</p>    <p>Both Phase I and Phase II projects proposed for this FOA must be designed to accelerate the development of these technologies and achieve specific benchmarks that are relevant to commercial feasibility. The overall goal is to facilitate technology development to the point that it would warrant a full commercialization effort and would have the potential to attract external investments, as needed. Given the strong emphasis on the commercial development of emerging analysis technologies beyond the prototype stages, project goals must be supplemented with specific key technical and commercially-relevant milestones.</p>    <p>Quantitative milestones are required for both Phase I and Phase II projects as well as for both phases of Fast-Track applications.</p>    <p>Beyond the scope of this FOA, it is anticipated (and encouraged) that the outcomes of successful SBIR projects will help attract strategic partners or investors to support the ultimate commercialization of the technology as a publicly available product or service.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Technology areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</strong></p>    <ul>    <li>Technologies capable of deciphering basic mechanisms underlying cancer initiation and progression;</li>    <li>Technologies that enable substantially-improved early cancer detection and/or cancer risk assessment;</li>    <li>Technologies capable of distinguishing, assessing, and/or monitoring cancer stage, and progression;</li>    <li>Technologies to facilitate/accelerate the processes of drug discovery or development of generic approaches to improve drug delivery;</li>    <li>Technologies that can facilitate and/or enhance molecular analyses in cancer epidemiology (e.g. by allowing for rigorous and/or expeditious collection of various relevant types of data);</li>    <li>Technologies for sample preparation and/or processing for improved downstream analysis;</li>    <li>Technologies that offer a novel means for assessing general analyte quality to determine sample fitness-for-purpose for a known analytical platform; and</li>    <li>Technologies or tools that may help overcome various barriers in research on the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer among members of underserved populations.</li>    </ul>    <p><strong>Technologies that are generally not appropriate for this FOA include the following:</strong></p>    <ul>    <li>Projects describing milestones that do not indicate advanced capabilities or offer progress towards commercialization;</li>    <li>Projects proposing software/informatics solutions, database development, data mining, statistical tools, and computational/mathematical modeling (including those applicable to drug and/or patient responses);</li>    <li>Projects in which the main thrust of effort is on exploring biological or clinical hypotheses (i.e. traditional hypothesis-driven projects) rather than on technology development;</li>    <li>Projects proposing whole-body or&nbsp;<em>in vivo</em>&nbsp;imaging methods; and</li>    <li>Projects centered on development of specific drugs or therapies.</li>    </ul>    <div class=""heading4"">Alternative Funding Opportunities</div>    <p>Researchers focusing on new bioinformatics or statistical techniques, tools, and/or software solutions should consider:</p>    <ul>    <li>one of the&nbsp;<strong>Informatics Technologies for Cancer Research FOAs</strong>&nbsp;(ITCR;&nbsp;<a href=""http://itcr.nci.nih.gov/"">http://itcr.nci.nih.gov</a>) opportunities; or</li>    <li>one of the&nbsp;<strong>Biomedical Information Science and Technology Initiative</strong>&nbsp;(BISTI;&nbsp;<a href=""http://bisti.nih.gov/"">http://bisti.nih.gov</a>) opportunities.</li>    <li>Researchers who emphasize the assessment of whole body or&nbsp;<em>in vivo</em>&nbsp;imaging technologies as the primary focus of their projects should contact the&nbsp;<strong>Cancer Imaging Program</strong>&nbsp;(CIP;&nbsp;<a href=""http://imaging.cancer.gov/"">http://imaging.cancer.gov/</a>) for information on appropriate funding opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>    </ul>    <div class=""heading4"">Annual Meeting</div>    <p>An annual meeting of all investigators funded through this program will be held to share progress and research insights that may lead to further progress in the development of technologies for cancer research and clinical care for cancer patients.

In every SPORE project, the development of new cancer-relevant interventions should include both a laboratory component and a human endpoint that must be reached during the project period of the grant.</p>    <p><strong>In each SPORE project, at least one of the following types of human endpoints should be proposed:</strong></p>    <ul>    <li>Early phase clinical trials of new investigational drugs, biologics, experimental procedures, medical devices, or combinations;</li>    <li>Early phase clinical trials of new combinations or new uses of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents and devices;</li>    <li>Discovery and development of biomarkers, only when measurements are made in human specimens, or directly in human subjects;</li>    <li>Laboratory studies that begin with an observation in the clinic and use human specimens to generate new clinical hypotheses;</li>    <li>Population, behavioral, or psychosocial studies, when these studies address mechanistic aspects of the biology of the disease;</li>    <li>Investigational new drug (IND)-directed toxicology studies conducted following a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in which the plan proposed by the investigators is acceptable to the FDA.</li>    </ul>    <p>Experiments using cell lines, xenografts, patient-derived xenografts (PDX), organoids, paired germline samples, or engineered tissues, may be important to the translational studies proposed and are encouraged, but are not sufficient to meet the human endpoint requirement.</p>    <p>All SPOREs must include at least one project that proposes a clinical trial which can serve as the required human endpoint for that proposed project.&nbsp; An IND-directed toxicology study can serve as a human endpoint, but is not sufficient to satisfy the clinical trial requirement. &nbsp;Inherent in this process is the interdependence between investigators conducting basic and applied research. Clinical and/or epidemiological research that does not include a wet laboratory or imaging component is not considered translational for the SPORE.</p>    <p><strong>Key definitions for the context of this FOA</strong></p>    <p class=""Bullet""><em>1. Translational Research:</em></p>    <p class=""ColorfulList-Accent11"">Translational research uses knowledge of human biology to develop and test the feasibility of cancer-relevant interventions in humans and/or determines the biological basis for observations made in individuals with cancer or in populations at risk for cancer. The term ""interventions"" is used in its broadest sense to include molecular assays, imaging techniques, drugs, biological agents, and/or other methodologies applicable to the prevention, early detection, diagnosis, prognosis, and/or treatment of cancer. SPORE translational research projects may involve the use of any cellular, molecular, structural, biochemical, and/or genetic experimental approaches. By this definition, SPORE projects are permitted to move not only in the forward direction, toward clinical trials and studies in areas of prevention, early detection, treatment, development of biomarkers, and population science, but also in the reverse direction, using human biospecimens, often from clinical trials, to study new phenomena, to optimize previous findings, or to develop new hypotheses based on results from human studies.</p>    <p class=""Bullet""><em>2. Early detection, prevention or population science (EPPS):</em></p>    <ul>    <li><em>Early Detection:</em>&nbsp;An early detection project is one that develops and/or tests an assay (biological or imaging) that determines the presence of an early invasive cancer or detects a pre-cancerous lesion, for which a subsequent intervention is established or for which an experimental intervention will be performed. This includes early detection of a new primary in a ""cancerized field"" (an area of epithelium surrounding an excised or treated primary tumor that contains genetically transformed, but histologically normal cells that are predisposed, perhaps because of continual carcinogenic insult, to subsequent tumor development.) Testing for metastases or recurrence of the primary tumor is not early detection. Although screening and early detection are sometimes used interchangeably, screening is the application of the assay in general populations and is beyond the scope of a SPORE project.</li>    <li><em>Prevention:</em>&nbsp;A prevention project investigates a medical, surgical, or lifestyle intervention that has as its aim the reduction of cancer incidence in individuals at risk. A project that addresses the prevention of a second primary tumor is also appropriate. A project that addresses prevention of cancer recurrence is not acceptable. A therapeutic vaccine in a no-evidence-of-disease state would not be considered secondary prevention, but rather a therapeutic intervention (i.e., adjuvant therapy.) However, a project that develops a vaccine that targets ""at risk"" lesions (e.g., pancreatic cysts, Barrett's esophagus or DCIS) is appropriate.</li>    <li><em>Population Science:</em>&nbsp;Population science aims to understand the causes and distribution of cancer in diverse populations, supports the development and delivery of effective interventions to reduce cancer risk, mortality and morbidity, as well as social cost of cancer, and monitors and explains cancer trends in all segments of the population. A population science project specifically in the SPORE may focus on study participants selected from sampling frames drawn from the general population, individuals at risk for cancer, or cancer patients. Unlike clinical trials with their specific inclusion criteria, population science studies should be sufficiently representational to allow for substantial external validity, i.e., generalized inferences to the target populations in the studies. Likewise, population science studies that focus on biomarker discovery and/or validation may not draw on specimens from convenience samples, such as a case series of highly selected patients, but instead must be drawn from a sampling frame that represents the target population under study and must be based on samples that allow for inferences to the target populations. SPORE Population Science project may draw upon already existing population science resources or may develop new cohorts in order to examine a specific translational research question in collaboration with basic, clinical, and population science investigators. An example of a project fitting the definition would be a study to validate the potential for biomarkers to predict the progression of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive cancer that uses a sampling frame of women undergoing routine breast cancer screening drawn from clinical practice. However, a project focused on biomarker discovery of DCIS that is based on tissue samples drawn from a case series of patients (particularly as part of a single clinical study) and who are not representative of the target population for breast cancer screening would not be appropriate.</li>    </ul>    <p class=""ColorfulList-Accent11""><em>3. Scientific Collaborations:</em></p>    <ul>    <li><em>Horizontal Collaboration:</em>&nbsp;Collaboration with others outside the SPORE to complete research aims or goals of that SPORE on a single level, that is, in the laboratory, or at the clinical trial stage, or as a population science study (e.g., collaborations with other SPOREs or use of industry provided agents).</li>    <li><em>Vertical Collaboration:</em>&nbsp;Collaboration with an entity outside the SPORE that extends SPORE translational research beyond the specific aims of projects along the translational continuum (e.g., from discovery, to pre-clinical development, to Phase I trials or studies, to later phase studies, and possibly to a final hand-off to a commercial company).</li>    </ul>    <p class=""ColorfulList-Accent11""><em>4. Clinical Trial:</em></p>    <p>A research study as defined by NIH (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/definition.htm). A population science study is acceptable if it meets this definition.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>General Description of SPOREs</strong></div>    <p>In most cases, SPOREs are expected to focus on a particular organ-specific cancer, such as breast or prostate, or a group of related cancers that belong to a common organ system, for example gastrointestinal cancers, neuroendocrine cancers, or sarcoma. Alternatively, some SPOREs may focus on cancers related by common biological pathway mutations/alterations or on cancers related by other cross-cutting themes, such as pediatric cancers, virus-related cancers, or cancer health disparities. In addition, all SPOREs include the following common features:</p>    <p><em>1. Translational Research Focus</em></p>    <p>All SPOREs must be focused on translational research that meets the definition provided above (see key definitions section). SPOREs are dedicated to capitalizing on research opportunities that have the potential to change the current paradigm in the prevention, detection, diagnosis, and/or treatment of human cancer. SPORE projects may include basic science objectives if those objectives are relevant to human cancer and will lead to a human endpoint within the 5-year project period of the grant.</p>    <p><em>2. Flexibility to Change Research Direction/Team Approach</em></p>    <p>The flexibility of the SPORE program was established in order for the PD(s)/PI(s) to terminate research projects that accomplished translational goals earlier than anticipated or that demonstrate little or no translational progress, and to replace them with new projects that have translational potential. As a result of this flexibility, the team of scientists that participates in SPORE projects may or may not remain the same, and the roles of co-leaders on projects may change throughout the course of the funding period. The flexibility option may not be used to add full scientific projects over and above the number that was peer reviewed, even if no new funds are requested.</p>    <p>The PD(s)/PI(s) of the SPORE are expected to make decisions about the continuation or discontinuation of projects in consultation with internal and external advisors, as well as with other lead investigators on the SPORE. The flexibility option is available only after the first year of the funding period for SPOREs with three or more scientific research projects; a new project cannot be proposed for one that has overlap with an awarded or soon-to-be awarded U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) grant. Although it is acceptable for investigators to concurrently submit the same or overlapping research proposal as a SPORE project as an independent R01, R21, etc., application to the NIH, PD(s)/PI(s) must be prepared to relinquish the R01 (or other single project) award if both are determined to be meritorious and eligible for funding. Investigators may not concurrently submit both a P01 and a P50 application requesting support for the same projects/activities. Potential overlap will be evaluated by NCI staff prior to award; submitted applications will not be reviewed if they do not conform to NIH policies or if they fail to meet the minimum requirements of the SPORE Program.</p>    <p><em>3. Specialized Research Infrastructure</em></p>    <p>SPOREs are expected to establish the critical research infrastructure needed to sustain the translational research projects proposed within the SPORE. SPOREs must be in a position to facilitate the complex research objectives inherent in studying human cancer. It is essential that robust mechanisms be in place for making shared resource data generated by the SPORE readily accessible to research and clinical investigators in the broader scientific community.</p>    <p>SPOREs should support the establishment of translational research cores that fill broad institutional infrastructure gaps. SPOREs also should utilize and augment existing cores within Cancer Centers and other institutional facilities wherever feasible. SPORE cores should not duplicate existing institutional cores, or other resources.</p>    <p><em>4. Fostering Translational Research Careers</em></p>    <p>SPOREs provide a unique environment for translational research that can be used to prepare new scientists for careers in this evolving field or provide the opportunity for established scientists to re-orient their research careers toward translational research.</p>    <p><em>5. Research Collaborations, Networks, and Consortia</em></p>    <p>SPOREs are expected to identify the kinds of research questions that can only be accomplished through collaborations, networks, and consortia and take full advantage of SPORE scientific expertise and infrastructure.</p>    <p><em>6. Intellectual Property Rights</em></p>    <p>Although an Intellectual Property Management Plan will not be included in the application, each SPORE must develop such a plan prior to award, that addresses evaluation, protection, and commercialization of solely or jointly owned SPORE inventions, including patenting and licensing strategies. All applicants are strongly encouraged to begin development of their plan while they are developing the projects.</p>    <p><em>7. Participation in NCI-Sponsored Meetings, Workshops, and other Activities</em></p>    <p>SPORE Directors and other SPORE investigators are expected to participate in NCI-sponsored meetings, workshops and working groups to share expertise and research results with other translational research grantees. Goals of these meetings may include identification of consensus data standards, sharing of materials and data, assessing progress, and identification of new collaborative opportunities.</p>    <div class=""heading4"">Major Components of SPORE Applications</div>    <p><em>1. Research Projects</em></p>    <p>Research projects may be conducted solely through the parent institution, or through collaborative associations that have been developed and/or are planned with other SPOREs and/or with other investigators in the biomedical research community. All SPOREs should meet the following criteria:</p>    <ul>    <li>A minimum of three projects each with a human endpoint must be proposed by new applications. Renewal SPORE applications have the&nbsp;<em>option</em>&nbsp;of submitting two projects, as opposed to the required minimum of three projects. Under this option, the two proposed projects must be large-scale, collaborative, and multi-institutional, addressing the most important questions within the organ site(s) or cross-cutting cancer theme. The two projects must draw on the successful outcomes of projects funded in the previous grant cycle and expand the original scope of each. Therefore, a new project will not be considered for the optional two-project submission.</li>    <li>Each proposed project must meet the definition of translational research as described in the key definitions section. Investigators who are not certain about whether their project fits this definition are advised to consult with Scientific/Research staff listed in Section VII. Agency Contacts.</li>    <li>Each proposed research project should be designed to test the relevance and/or potential importance of the research to human cancer within the project period of the grant. Projects containing basic research (e.g., employing animal models or cell lines) qualify as translational only if a human endpoint is included in the specific aims.</li>    <li>At least one SPORE project must incorporate a clinical trial.</li>    <li>SPORE projects should represent a balance and diversity of translational research objectives (e.g., early detection, prevention, diagnosis, treatment).</li>    <li>SPOREs should describe a program-wide consent process that would inform patients about the: 1) risks and rewards of participating in the clinical study SPORE program; and 2) possibility that some data may be made available to private sector collaborators that would enable use of individual patient information in research that is not envisioned at the time of consent.</li>    </ul>    <p><em>SPORE applications are encouraged to include the following:</em></p>    <ul>    <li>Research and patient advocates with a collective patient perspective to be an integral component of the SPORE Program</li>    <li>Early Detection, Prevention, or Population Science (EPPS; see key definitions section) projects as defined below in the Research Project Section.</li>    <li>Research projects that bring together investigators from multiple institutions to facilitate the development of large-scale team-based projects.</li>    </ul>    <p><em>2. Administrative Core</em></p>    <p>An Administrative Core is required. This Core describes the SPORE's organization and capabilities, including the organizational, administrative, and scientific and data management of the SPORE and explains how coordination and communication among the different projects and programs, Shared Resources Cores, and participating institutions will be achieved at the overall program level.</p>    <p><em>3. Shared Resources Cores</em></p>    <p>SPORE applications are required to include a Biospecimen/Pathology Shared Resource Core and have the option to include other Shared Resources Cores that provide laboratory and/or clinical facilities, equipment, and/or services to be shared by one or more research projects and the developmental programs. A Biostatistical Core is strongly encouraged. Shared Resources Cores may include non&ndash;hypothesis-driven research activities (e.g., technology development) provided that the research is designed to improve Core services.</p>    <p>The Shared Resources Cores within the SPORE should not duplicate any shared resource facilities that are already available to the research group but may build upon these facilities for unique capabilities required by the SPORE.</p>    <p><em>4. Developmental Research Program (DRP)</em></p>    <p>Each SPORE must allocate a significant effort to support pilot projects that take maximum advantage of new research opportunities in the organ site or group of related cancers that are the focus of the SPORE. The pilot projects may be collaborative among scientists within one or more SPOREs, or with scientists outside the SPORE community. High-risk/high-payoff pilot projects are especially encouraged. These pilot projects do not need to reach a human endpoint during the project period as do full projects.</p>    <p>As a required component of a SPORE, a DRP must be maintained throughout the entire term of the grant. The DRP should be structured in a way that the awards run in parallel with the current budget period. With the approval of the SPORE's External Advisory Board and the assigned NCI TRP Program Director, DRP studies may become full SPORE projects as part of the flexibility option if the DRP study has translational research potential within the SPORE and incorporates a human endpoint within one of the project aims.</p>    <p><em>5. Career Enhancement Program (CEP)</em></p>    <p>The SPORE must demonstrate a consistent and substantial commitment to a Career Enhancement Program (CEP) in translational research. As a required element of the SPORE, the CEP must be maintained throughout the entire term of the funding period. The CEP should be structured in a way that the awards run in parallel with the current budget period. Funds from this program may be used to support junior faculty or established investigators who wish to enhance or refocus their careers on translational research. This program is not a training program and does not support pre- or post-doctoral fellows, either pre-clinical or clinical. However, advanced post-doctoral or clinical fellows who provide a letter from an institution stating that the candidate will be joining its faculty within the year are eligible for this program. Investigators supported by NCI career development awards (K series) may also be eligible for support through this program. Similar to DRP projects, CEP may become full projects as part of the flexibility option with the approval of the SPORE's External Advisory Board and the NCI TRP Program Director.</p>    <p><em>6. Scientific Collaboration</em></p>    <p>Each SPORE must demonstrate a commitment to both horizontal and vertical collaboration (see key definitions section) in completing preclinical projects and moving promising results along the pathway of translational/clinical development. Through the promotion of inter-SPORE research, SPOREs also conceive and initiate research that is further linked to other key programs of the NCI, NIH, and other government and non-government programs. Acceleration of therapeutic agent development or biomarker development is encouraged.&nbsp; However, not every project within a SPORE must involve collaborations.</p>    <div class=""heading4"">Pre-application Communications with NCI Staff</div>    <p>Each prospective SPORE applicant is advised to schedule a pre-application consultation with the assigned NCI staff. The consultation should be scheduled at least 4 to 6 months in advance of the application due date and is intended to help the PD/PI (along with one or more of his/her intended co-investigators) understand the Program and its translational objectives, and discuss strategies for preparing a competitive application. NCI staff will clarify SPORE requirements and current NCI budget allocations, and describe the peer-review process. The NCI staff can also answer questions about NCI-supported clinical trial and other collaborative resources that might be available beyond the funded activities of the SPORE.</p>    <p>PDs/PIs for resubmitted and renewal applications have also found it useful to schedule a pre-application discussion with NCI staff, since program and review policies may have changed since the previous submission.</p>    <p>Requests for supplemental funding for SPOREs are rare and may be awarded only in unusual and compelling circumstances. Those awardees who wish to submit such an application are encouraged to speak first with their Program Officer at the NCI.</p>; <div class=""heading2""><strong>Award Information</strong></div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Funding Instrument</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>Grant: A support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Application Types Allowed</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>New&nbsp;<br />Renewal&nbsp;<br />Resubmission&nbsp;<br />Revision</p>    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11116"">OER Glossary</a>&nbsp;and the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide provide details on these application types.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Clinical Trial?</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>Required: Only accepting applications that propose clinical trial(s)</p>    <p><a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=82370"">Need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?</a></p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Funds Available and Anticipated Number of Awards</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>The number of awards is contingent upon NIH appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.</p>    <p>Approximately four to eight SPORE awards per year are anticipated.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Award Budget</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>Applicants may request a maximum of $1,400,000 direct costs/year, which excludes third party indirect costs.

They may help meet the need for nonpharmacologic approaches for the management of pain and other common, troublesome symptoms resistant to standard care, and they may also play a role in interventions to optimize wellness. However, there are gaps in the understanding of the mechanisms by which these approaches exert their effects&mdash;and this has made it difficult to determine whether they are well suited for specific conditions or target populations. The complexity of many mind and body approaches has also been a barrier to understanding their effects. Therefore, substantial study of the fundamental science of mind and body approaches is needed.</p>    <p>This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) encourages research grant applications (R01) to investigate the fundamental science of mind and body approaches, including mind/brain-focused practices (e.g., meditation, hypnosis), body-based approaches (e.g., acupuncture, massage, spinal manipulation/mobilization), meditative exercise (e.g., yoga, tai chi, qi gong), art and music therapies, or integrative approaches combining several components. Studies of pharmacologic approaches exclusively are not included in the scope of this FOA.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Fundamental research on mind and body approaches can address&nbsp;<strong>three key aspects</strong>. The first is&nbsp;<strong>the approach itself</strong>: What components impact the biological system or subjective experience? The second is&nbsp;<strong>the biological system</strong>&nbsp;potentially targeted by the approach: What cellular systems or hormonal, genetic, or neural mediators, for example, are influenced by the intervention? The third is&nbsp;<strong>the mechanisms</strong>: What are the key processes (i.e., biological and/or behavioral) by which the approach exerts its effects?</p>    <p>The goal of this FOA is to support fundamental science research projects that address at least one of these three aspects. The FOA can support research to deconstruct the components of mind and body approaches and analyze their effects on both biological systems and subjective experience. It can also support the development and optimization of mind and body interventions, but it will not support clinical efficacy or effectiveness trials. Studies carried out in response to this FOA should use the most appropriate model systems for the mechanism being investigated. Processes and mechanisms may be analyzed and studied at many levels, including biochemical, molecular, cellular, genetic, epigenetic, genomic and epigenomic, systems, network, physiological, neurobiological, behavioral, and social interaction analysis.</p>    <p>There should be adequate justification for applicants' choice of the mind and body approach they propose to study, including the prevalence of use, the evidence supporting its value and safety, gaps in knowledge, and opportunities to advance the relevant science.</p>    <p>The mechanisms and processes by which mind and body approaches act on targeted biological systems may be very broad. This FOA encourages interdisciplinary collaborations by experts from multiple fields&mdash;neuroscientists, psychologists, endocrinologists, immunologists, geneticists, pharmacologists, chemists, physicists, behavioral scientists, and others in relevant fields of inquiry, including scientists based at either research-intensive institutions or those who train complementary practitioners.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Examples of types of investigations appropriate for this FOA include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>    <ul>    <li>Determine the perceptual, neurocognitive, and/or behavioral mechanisms underlying a mind and body approach.</li>    <li>Analyze the neural mechanisms of emotional regulation, affective function, or social interaction affected by a mind and body approach.</li>    <li>Examine the arousal and regulatory systems for sleep and wake cycles and the default mode network influenced by a mind and body approach.</li>    <li>Elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying cortical or higher order neural control of brain regions primarily responsible for autonomic neural function relevant to a mind and body approach.</li>    <li>Assess the mechanistic effects of mind and body approaches on local musculoskeletal systems and connective tissues and/or neuromuscular interactions.</li>    <li>Study mechanisms by which mind and body approaches regulate neuroinflammatory processes or the functioning of the immune, endocrine, or vascular systems.</li>    <li>Determine the molecular mechanisms and neural pathways by which mind and body approaches affect the ascending and/or descending process to regulate pain or pain-related functions.</li>    <li>Conduct imaging studies of central nervous system structure and function to elucidate underlying mechanisms of a given mind and body approach.</li>    <li>Assess whether multiple biological mechanism may simultaneously contribute to the effects of a mind and body approach.</li>    <li>Compare the mechanisms and processes by which mind and body approaches affect symptom management or well-being.</li>    <li>Develop or validate novel psychological, behavioral, or imaging instruments or analytic tools to deconstruct the complexity of mind and body approaches in healthy human subjects or clinical populations.</li>    <li>Develop and validate biomarkers for chronic pain or other key symptoms to be used in studies of mind and body approaches.</li>    <li>Where appropriate, develop animal models or in vitro systems that can be used to study cellular effects, neuromuscular interactions, changes in inflammatory processes, or other biological mechanisms underlying mind and body approaches.</li>    </ul>    <p>For this FOA, NCCIH considers applications of mind and body approaches to symptom management and promotion of well-being as a high program priority. Topics of interest include:</p>    <ul>    <li>Pain and pain management</li>    <li>Sleep and sleep disturbances</li>    <li>Symptoms associated with conditions such as stress, menopause, and chronic fatigue</li>    <li>Mental health conditions commonly managed in primary care, such as mild-to-moderate depression or anxiety</li>    <li>Promoting healthy behaviors, such as healthy eating and physical activity</li>    <li>Promoting general well-being.</li>    </ul>    <p>Studies of other clinical symptoms or conditions may be supported if they would shed light on the general mechanisms of action of mind and body approaches. Studies aimed at developing treatments for specific symptoms or conditions are not appropriate for this FOA.</p>    <p>NCCIH encourages outstanding fundamental or basic science researchers to submit applications in response to this exciting opportunity.

In addition, accurate IADL/ADL measures can help to inform family members, caregivers, and health-care providers about the functional status and needs of independent-living older individuals.</p>    <p>Given the relations between performance of IADLs/ADLs, physical health and cognitive function, and independent living, researchers have developed an array of indicators and instruments to measure and track the trajectory of performance of IADLs/ADLs in older individuals.&nbsp; In fact, data collected with IADL/ADL measures figure prominently in gerontological research across natural (biological sciences, including neuroscience) and social-scientific disciplines, and are often used to characterize and predict physical and cognitive decline and dementia, as well as to develop interventions to arrest the development and/or mitigate the effects of decrements in physical health and cognitive function.</p>    <p>However, the experience of growing older in America is changing and many older adults live alone and may not have family caregivers or close friends to make accurate assessments of their daily function.&nbsp; Such assessments may facilitate and inform efforts to prevent unwanted and adverse health and life outcomes.</p>    <p>In addition, many clinical research studies or interventional therapeutic clinical trials, focusing on cognition and/or dementia require a ""study partner""--one who accompanies study participants on periodic visits for clinical assessment. Efforts to increase participation in such studies by older members of underserved and under-represented populations have been complicated as many are particularly isolated. The opportunity to remotely measure these functional abilities in real world situations may reduce the need for the ""study partner"" and also for the participants to travel to medical or academic centers, thereby increasing recruitment success while at the same time, allowing more diverse and at-risk participants.</p>    <p>Many current IADL/ADL scales assess or sample only a single domain of function or performance, which limits the range and type of potentially useful data/information that can be collected and investigated.&nbsp; Other scales may include more domains of function but are longer, more challenging to complete, and may require training to administer.&nbsp; Furthermore, many scales use discrete rather than continuous indicators, which may not be advantageous.&nbsp; Measurements of discrete data typically require larger samples (more data points), may yield lower sensitivity, and may limit the kinds of analysis that can be done.&nbsp; Finally, many existing measures only indirectly assess the functions they are aiming to capture.&nbsp; New technological solutions can be designed to address many of these limitations.</p>    <p>Enhanced mobile-based measures would be useful in the early detection of changes in IADL/ADL performance.&nbsp; Early detection of decrements in IADL/ADL performance would allow researchers, physicians, and caregivers to identify and monitor increasing risks for deteriorating cognitive function (progressing from a subjective memory complainer to MCI and from MCI to AD/ADRD).&nbsp;</p>    <p>Innovations in technology are revolutionizing health-related research, allowing for more frequent, more accurate, more inclusive assessments of research participants in their normal environments relative to assessments conducted at a clinical research center.&nbsp; Today's middle aged and older adults are increasingly using technology, including smart phones and other mobile devices.&nbsp; Recent data illustrates that smartphone usage is roughly equivalent across different racial and ethnic groups in the US.&nbsp; Additionally, many of the newer technologies require less active engagement, knowledge and effort on the part of the users (e.g., wearable accelerometers).&nbsp; There is considerable opportunity to dramatically advance understanding of everyday functioning and the relationship to cognition for diverse (racial, ethnic, socio-economic) populations of aging adults and those individuals with AD/ADRD.</p>    <p>Objectives</p>    <p>The goal of this announcement is to encourage research grant applications to develop wearable, mobile, or other technology to enable direct, objective, and continuous data capture of everyday functions in individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD. Mobile technology now affords an opportunity to enhance the sensitivity and utility of IADL/ADL data in dementia research and particularly in research focused on interventions for AD and related dementias of aging using unobtrusive, direct, objective, multi-domain, continuous, and real-time measures.</p>    <p>Projects should be relevant to NIA programs and priorities as described in the NIA 2015 Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit recommendations, which are available at:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/recommendations-nih-ad-research-summit-2015"">https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/recommendations-nih-ad-research-summit-2015</a>.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The following functional activities should be considered for inclusion:</p>    <ul>    <li>management of medical and social appointments;</li>    <li>financial and transaction monitoring;</li>    <li>engagement in social activities;</li>    <li>shopping;</li>    <li>engaging in hobbies or other personal interests;</li>    <li>doing chores at home (i.e., laundry, cleaning);</li>    <li>operating appliances or gadgets</li>    <li>preparing meals;</li>    <li>managing medications;</li>    <li>driving; and</li>    <li>maintaining personal hygiene (i.e., bathing, brushing teeth, etc.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>    </ul>    <p>Applicants are encouraged to consider steps taken to demonstrate the psychometric viability (that is, validity and reliability) of any measurement constructs developed for the proposed mobile-based IADL/ADL measurement technology.&nbsp; Furthermore, NIA anticipates that the IADL/ADL data collected with the use of mobile-based technology will be amenable to data-reduction techniques and other quantitative analytical methods.</p>    <p>Finally, NIA also encourages applicants to incorporate data-security architecture into the research and development of the mobile-based measurement technology.</p>; <div class=""heading2""><strong>Award Information</strong></div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Funding Instrument</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>Grant: A support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel"">Application Types Allowed</div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>New (Phase I, Fast-Track)<br />Renewal (Phase II* Direct Phase II&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;allowed)<br />Resubmission (all phases)<br />Revision</p>    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11116"">OER Glossary</a>&nbsp;and the SF424 (R&amp;R) SBIR/STTR Application Guide provide details on these application types.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel"">Clinical Trial?</div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>Not Allowed: Only accepting applications that do not propose clinical trials</p>    <p><a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=82370"">Need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?</a></p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel"">Funds Available and Anticipated Number of Awards</div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>The number of awards is contingent upon NIH appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel"">Award Budget</div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>Budgets up to $350,000 total costs per year for Phase I and up to $2,000,000 total costs per year for Phase II may be requested.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel"">Award Project Period</div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>According to statutory guidelines, award periods normally may not exceed 1 year for Phase I and 2 years for Phase II.

The uterine maternal tissue is remodeled into a form that is compatible with both organisms. This interplay between the two is orchestrated in such a way that the developing fetus although semi-allogeneic is not rejected by the mother. There is ample evidence to show that the mother is exquisitely aware of the foreignness of the fetus but in a myriad of ways does not reject the fetus. It has also been established that the maternal cellular and non-cellular components are in intimate contact with the prenatal milieu before and after blood flow is established via the umbilical arteries after the first trimester of pregnancy. It is also well established that fetal cellular and non-cellular elements are found in the maternal tissues and circulation.</p>    <p>Since components including cells of the immune system develop early in gestation and are essential for the normal development of the fetus through pregnancy, and evolve with in utero environmental exposures it would be of interest to evaluate the inter-communication that occurs between the mother and fetus throughout pregnancy and after birth, especially in the context of infectious disease.</p>    <p>It has been shown that cells of the immune system develop early in gestation. B lymphocytes develop in the fetal liver by week 9 and are in the spleen and circulate by week 12 and T lymphocytes leave the thymus at about week 14 and travel to the spleen. It has also been suggested that all the elements of the mature immune system are functional in fetal life but that the robustness of the system is tempered by maternal and perhaps placental toning.

How organizational-level factors influence the implementation of care planning and its associated costs is also of interest. Specifically, the FOA aims to stimulate research that will: 1) develop and test metrics for evaluating the impact of survivorship care planning; 2) evaluate the impact of survivorship care planning on cancer survivors' morbidity, self-management and adherence to care recommendations, utilization of follow-up care; 3) evaluate effects of planning on systems outcomes, such as associated costs and impact on providers and organizations implementing the care planning; and 4) identify models and processes of care that promote effective survivorship care planning. The ultimate goal of this FOA is to generate a body of science that will inform the development and delivery of interventions that improve follow-up care for cancer survivors.</p>    <p>This FOA uses the R21 mechanism. The R21 activity code is intended to encourage new exploratory and developmental research projects. For example, such projects could assess the feasibility of a novel area of investigation or a new experimental system that has the potential to enhance health-related research. Another example could include the unique and innovative use of an existing methodology to explore a new scientific area. These studies may involve considerable risk but may lead to a breakthrough in a particular area, or to the development of novel techniques, agents, methodologies, models, or applications that could have a major impact on a field of biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research.</p>    <p>Applications for R21 awards should describe projects distinct from those supported through the traditional R01 activity code.

Cancer survivors may experience a host of long-term and late effects of cancer and cancer therapy and many comorbid conditions that require coordinated follow-up care after completion of primary treatment for cancer. Researchers and health care delivery systems have expressed the need to understand how best to structure, coordinate and deliver survivorship care that affects these late effects and how to pay for such care.</p>    <p><strong>Follow-up Care and Care Planning for Cancer Survivors</strong></p>    <p>The Institute of Medicine (IOM, 2005) recommended that all patients completing primary cancer treatment be provided with a comprehensive treatment summary and a survivorship care plan, to be reviewed with the patient during an end-of-treatment consultation. The treatment summary, care plan, and consultative visit were intended to improve care coordination and patient knowledge about the late and long-term effects of cancer, and recommended follow-up care. The Institute of Medicine Report also called for health services research to assess the impact, cost, and acceptability of survivorship care plans to patients and providers. Subsequently, the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer recommended provision of treatment summaries and care plans as a standard of quality oncology practice effective in January of 2015. While there has been some growth in our understanding of how care plans are being implemented, there continues to be limited knowledge of the impact of care plans on morbidity, healthcare utilization, and costs to patients. There is even less evidence regarding which delivery and coordination strategies have the highest impact and which are most likely to be feasible, scalable, cost-effective, readily adoptable, consistently implemented, and sustainable. Critical to this evidence is an understanding of the human and system factors that affect care plan use and effects. If treatment summaries and care plans are to become a standard of care, it is critical that we understand their efficacy, viability and mechanism of effect in real world settings.</p>    <p><strong>Key Meetings on Cancer Survivorship Care Planning</strong></p>    <p>The Institute of Medicine hosted a workshop on survivorship care planning in 2006, in which it addressed the need for the evaluation and implementation of care planning. The NCI&rsquo;s Office of Cancer Survivorship subsequently led March 2011, and June 2014 workshops on care planning that revealed a need to rigorously evaluate the impact of survivorship care planning and to focus on exploring the efficacy of care planning, the costs and effects of care planning in the context of new care delivery models, and the feasibility and viability of implementation. The importance of follow-up care planning in survivorship was reinforced by the September 2011 LiveSTRONG Essential Elements meeting, in which 125 thought leaders and stakeholders used the Institute of Medicine recommendations to develop consensus regarding the essential elements in survivorship care. Provision of a treatment summary/care plan, and a care coordination strategy for cancer survivors appeared in the top tier of consensus elements.</p>    <p><strong>Preliminary Evidence on the Impact of Survivorship Care Planning</strong></p>    <p>Preliminary research suggests survivorship care planning may be related to improved compliance with recommended medical surveillance, reductions in duplicative health care procedures, and improvements in patient confidence about and preparedness for follow-up care. However, it is unclear whether survivorship care planning demonstrates added benefit when compared to usual care. Implementation challenges in care planning include low concordance of observed care plan content with IOM content recommendations, time burden and lack of reimbursement for treatment summaries/care plans, lack of clarity regarding who is responsible for generating and communicating the care plan to patients and providers, and lack of cost-effectiveness data. The IOM report has been the basis for the most developed research in care planning. The IOM-recommended content for survivorship care plans includes the following elements: patient&rsquo;s cancer specific information (e.g., diagnosis, stage, pathology, etc.), treatment history and potential consequences; recommendations for surveillance, prevention and health maintenance; information about psychosocial sequelae, and community resources to address psychosocial issues; and detailed plans for follow-up care and coordination.</p>    <p>The scant research literature, in conjunction with the IOM&rsquo;s goals and recommended content for care plans, suggest a research agenda focused on assessment of whether and how care planning is implemented; evaluation of concordance of care plan content with IOM recommended elements; effects of care planning on physical and psychosocial morbidity, surveillance and management of chronic and late effects of cancer, health care resource utilization, organizational-level factors influencing implementation, and exploration of the costs associated with care planning. Comparative studies using rigorous and appropriate measures and design approaches are needed to better understand if and how care planning interventions may affect survivors' morbidity, utilization of health care, adherence to healthy behavior and surveillance guidelines, health care utilization, and related costs.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Specific Research Objectives</strong></div>    <p>Applications are expected to assess whether care planning renders added benefits in terms of reducing morbidity, increasing adherence to follow-up guidelines, better self-management of late effects, appropriate utilization of follow-up care, and reduced cost.&nbsp; The proposed research should also evaluate the pathways and processes through which such benefit is derived and clarify to whom such benefits accrue (survivors, clinicians, delivery systems, payers). Transdisciplinary approaches that link health services and health economics research with clinical, behavioral, and social science disciplines are encouraged. Studies documenting the organizational context and key processes through which successful care planning occurs are invited, including those that study how the generation and use of survivorship care plans intersects with processes of care delivery, inter-provider communication, patient-provider communication, and meaningful use of informatics. Studies linking care planning to use of electronic medical records, and exploring ways to harness electronic platforms, tools and applications are encouraged. Studies of how successful care planning initiatives are implemented in a variety of healthcare and community practice settings are encouraged. Studies may include family and caregiver outcomes in addition to survivor outcomes. Studies that will be considered for funding are limited to those that focus on individuals diagnosed with cancer at age 21 or older.</p>    <p><strong>Research Applications are particularly encouraged to consider the following issues in the Research Strategy:</strong></p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Inclusion of at least one survivor-level outcome (behavioral, physical and/or psychosocial morbidity) and at least one provider or system-level outcome (service use, time use, knowledge) related to care delivery or cost.</li>    <li>Studies assessing the impact of care planning or identifying effective models of care are expected to use comparative designs (randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental, case-control, interrupted time series, or similar designs) that allow comparison of care planning strategies.</li>    <li>Adjunctive qualitative or quantitative observational approaches are encouraged in the context of the above designs.</li>    <li>Because the standard of care is not yet consistently established, investigators are expected to carefully document and describe the care planning protocol studied in all inquiries.

It is estimated that over five million people in the United States have AD in its various stages at an estimated cost to society of over $200 billion per year.&nbsp; It is projected that 11 to 16 million people and their families could be affected by AD by the middle of this century if no effective therapies are developed to prevent, slow or stop the disease.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">The vast majority of older adults will experience some deterioration in cognitive function as they age.&nbsp; This age-related cognitive decline may presage AD or other neurodegenerative disorders, but even when it does not it can have substantial influence on quality of life, character of personal relationships, and the capacity for making informed decisions about health care, retirement, and other issues faced daily by millions of adults.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Currently there are only a few interventions that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of AD, and those approved have demonstrated only modest effects in modifying the clinical symptoms for relatively short periods.&nbsp; None has shown a clear effect on disease progression.&nbsp; The Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association&rsquo;s 2015 trajectory report estimated that a treatment delaying onset by five years and beginning to show its effect in 2025 would decrease the total number of older Americans with Alzheimer&rsquo;s from 8.2 million to 5.8 million in 2030. &nbsp;Moreover, a treatment that even slowed disease progression would result in far fewer people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in the severe stage that requires the highest level of care with the greatest costs.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">In response to this looming public health crisis in the United States and worldwide, a growing number of countries are increasing their investment in all aspects of AD research.&nbsp; On January 4, 2011, President Obama signed into law the National Alzheimer&rsquo;s Project Act (NAPA).&nbsp; As part of the Strategic Planning Process for the implementation of the National Alzheimer&rsquo;s Project Act, (see&nbsp;<a href=""http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/"">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/</a>&nbsp;for more information) the National Institute on Aging (NIA) at the NIH with support from the Foundation for the NIH (FNIH) organized and hosted two Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease Research Summits entitled &ldquo;Path to Treatment and Prevention,&rdquo; which was held on the NIH campus in May 2012 and February 2015. &nbsp;The overarching goal of the summits was to formulate a strategy for a new integrated, multidisciplinary research agenda to enable the development of effective therapies (disease modifying and palliative) across the disease continuum for the cognitive as well as neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and to identify the resources, infrastructure, and public private partnerships necessary to successfully implement this translational agenda. This FOA is consistent with the recommendations of these AD research summits,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nia.nih.gov/newsroom/alzheimers-disease-research-summit-2012-recommendations"">http://www.nia.nih.gov/newsroom/alzheimers-disease-research-summit-2012-recommendations</a>;&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/recommendations-nih-ad-research-summit-2015"">https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/recommendations-nih-ad-research-summit-2015</a>.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Maintenance of cognitive health with age is also a growing public health imperative.&nbsp; The 2010 Cognitive Aging Summit, held by the NIA in conjunction with the McKnight Brain Research Foundation (MBRF) and the Foundation for NIH (FNIH), included recommendations to &ldquo;increase opportunities at the interface of basic and clinical science to enhance the clinical trial enterprise&rdquo; and &ldquo;encourage more integrative models of mechanisms for age-related decline/maintenance/adaptation.&rdquo; In 2014, the NIA, in collaboration with the MBRF and the FNIH, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) and the NIH Office of Behavioral and Social Research (OBSSR), published an FOA, the purpose of which was to encourage the development of therapeutic approaches that aim to drive beneficial plasticity of the aging brain and remediate age-related cognitive decline.&nbsp; Recently, the Institute of Medicine completed a study of the public health dimensions of cognitive aging, entitled &ldquo;Cognitive Aging: Progress in Understanding and Opportunities for Action&rdquo; (<a href=""http://iom.nationalacademies.org/Reports/2015/Cognitive-Aging.aspx"">http://iom.nationalacademies.org/Reports/2015/Cognitive-Aging.aspx</a>).&nbsp; The study report included the recommendation for single- and multi-component clinical trials of promising interventions to promote cognitive health and prevent cognitive decline, testing for both cognitive status and functional outcomes.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives</strong></div>    <p class=""regulartext"">The goal of this FOA is to invite research grant applications that provide clinical testing (Phase I and II) of promising pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals with age-related cognitive decline and in individuals with AD across the spectrum from pre-symptomatic to more severe stages of disease, as well as to stimulate studies to enhance trial design and methods.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Examples of interventions for evaluation include but are not limited to: pharmacological interventions that target eradication or progression of deposition of disease neuropathology; repurposed drugs that have promise for AD treatment such as chemotherapeutic agents or drugs for insulin dysregulation/diabetes; novel cognitive training or cognitive engagement approaches; aerobic exercise and/or other movement therapies, such as Tai Chi; sleep enhancement; mindfulness-based stress reduction; nutritional supplementation or adoption of specific dietary programs; and/or combinations of interventions including the mixture of pharmacological with non-pharmacological therapeutics.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">This FOA encourages clinical trial applications including but not limited to the following:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li><strong>Studies to refine the intervention strategy.</strong>&nbsp; These studies could include work to determine appropriate dosage of drugs, duration of treatment, and the delivery system. &nbsp;For non-pharmacological interventions, such work might examine the intensity or duration of therapy required. &nbsp;For all interventions, the potential synergistic effects of combined interventions could be explored.</li>    <li><strong>Studies to evaluate the safety and/or efficacy of the intervention(s).&nbsp;</strong></li>    <li><strong>Studies that elucidate mechanism of action.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, there may be interventions that have some level of demonstrated efficacy (e.g., exercise for age-related cognitive decline), but lack a real understanding of the mechanism of action.

Currently, there are more than 50 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved oral anticancer agents and it is expected that the rate of development, approval, and use of these medications will continue to increase. Achieving maximal benefit of oral anticancer agents requires that they are prescribed and used properly. This necessitates tracking utilization, identifying factors that influence adherence, and organizing care delivery systems to support appropriate and safe use by clinicians and patients. Whereas traditional parenteral chemotherapy is administered in controlled clinical settings with oncologist, nurses, and pharmacists providing care according to national safety standards, the newer oral anticancer agents are administered and monitored by patients and caregivers in the home.</p>    <p>Adherence to oral anticancer agents, especially the molecularly targeted agents, is critical to achieving an optimal clinical outcome. For example, the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, depends on strict adherence to the treatment regimen. Suboptimal adherence can not only lead to poor survival, but to side effects and toxicities, unnecessary treatment change, increased use of health care resources, and decreased patient satisfaction. However, the numerous patient, system, and treatment factors that can influence utilization and adherence to oral anticancer agents are poorly understood. There is little information about the adoption of newly approved oral agents--particularly those that have been approved through an accelerate pathway--and the provider factors that influence prescribing and monitoring of new therapies. A better understanding of cancer patients' sociodemographic characteristics, social context, and concomitant medical conditions is needed to evaluate disparities in access and appropriate prescribing. There is also scant information about the effect of genomic testing on off-label use of oral anticancer agents, and patient and provider characteristics associated with off-label prescribing.</p>    <p>Oral treatment regimens may be complex and require multiple daily doses and intricate treatment schedules. Despite the targeted nature of many of these new agents, use of these drugs may be accompanied by adverse events that are often unknown until the drugs have been widely used. Such adverse events can limit the benefit of new treatments, particularly for vulnerable subgroups-- such as the elderly and individuals with comorbidities--who are often excluded from clinical trials. The complexity of many oral anticancer regimens and the difficulty managing side effects of these drugs in the home have been strongly associated with suboptimal adherence, which can result in therapeutic failure. Moreover, many oral anticancer agents have a limited half-life, which can greatly impact the amount of non-adherence that can be tolerated before compromising treatment effectiveness and thus, patient outcomes.</p>    <p>There is an emerging need for health care systems to establish new roles and responsibilities, models of care, technology support, patient education strategies, and interventions for coordinating care of patients receiving oral anticancer agents. A recent review of oral anticancer agent-related incidents found that it was not uncommon for patients to miss doses, take the wrong dose or wrong medication, or take their medication for the wrong number of days. Oncology professionals, primary care providers, and pharmacists need to understand the complex issues of adherence, and systems need to be designed to incorporate adherence assessments and interventions to improve symptom management into care.</p>    <p>In addition to understanding how oral anticancer agents are being prescribed and used, and how the health care delivery system is meeting the needs of cancer patients on oral therapies, we need to understand the individual-level factors that influence adherence: cognitive factors (e.g., beliefs about the safety of oral agents), emotional factors (e.g., depression), motivational factors (e.g., desire to maintain high quality of life), factors that influence decision making (e.g., tolerance of uncertainty), social factors (e.g., social support), and biological factors (e.g., comorbid conditions). Interventions to improve adherence to oral anticancer medication have demonstrated only limited success, largely because they fail to consider the dynamic psychosocial, cultural, and economic contexts that shape adherence behavior. Adherence to oral anticancer therapy should be considered in the context of the patient's clinical status, comorbid conditions, treatment expectations, and social situation. It is expected that adherence may fluctuate due to disease characteristics, the impact of side effects, changes in functional status, changing expectations of treatment, or difficulties acquiring medication.</p>    <div class=""heading4"">Specific Research Objectives and Scope of this FOA</div>    <p>This FOA encourages interdisciplinary studies that merge expertise from diverse areas of science and clinical disciplines (e.g., oncology, primary care, nursing, pharmacy).</p>    <p><strong>Research questions of interest include, but are not limited to the following:</strong></p>    <p><strong>A) Utilization</strong></p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent"">1, What are current trends in utilization of newly approved molecularly targeted oral therapies?</p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent"">2.

This group includes people who label themselves (or are labeled) as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, as well as people who do not adopt such labels but nevertheless experience same-sex attraction or engage in same-sex sexual behaviors.</li>    <li>A second group includes individuals whose gender identity differs from the sex originally assigned to them at birth; whose gender expression varies significantly from what is traditionally associated with or typical for that group; and/or who vary from or reject traditional cultural conceptualizations of gender in terms of male-female dichotomy. This group includes people who label themselves (or are labeled) as transgendered, transsexual, cross-dressers, transvestites, and/or two-spirit.</li>    <li>A third group includes individuals who are born with external and/or internal genitalia that vary from typical male or female genitalia, or a chromosomal pattern that varies from XX (female) or XY (male). This group includes people who label themselves (or are labeled) as intersex or with Disorders of Sexual Development [DSD].&nbsp;</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p class=""regulartext"">Following recent usage, the term Sexual and Gender Minority [SGM] is used to designate both these populations overall and the individuals within these populations.&nbsp; Applicants may adopt other classification frameworks and terminologies as appropriate for their proposed research.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Recent data from national health surveys and targeted studies suggest that prevalence rates for some health conditions are higher among SGM populations than for the general population.

Research submitted to this FOA should focus on clearly defined health outcomes, rather than on general measures of ""well-being"" or ""adjustment."" This FOA encourages researchers to investigate new research questions related to the health and development of SGM populations and individuals and their families and to develop and/or apply innovative methodologies to improve understanding of mechanisms affecting their health and development.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">This FOA encourages four main types of research.</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Basic social and behavioral science studies addressing the processes involved as individuals discover, uncover, address and/or adapt to their sexual orientation and claim or do not claim identity as SGM, and how these processes affect the mental and physical health of the individual.</li>    <li>Research leading to interventions to ameliorate health disparities in SGM populations. Formative research may be necessary because evidence-based preventive and treatment interventions for SGM individuals, particularly for adolescents and young adults, are scarce.</li>    <li>Large-scale design, implementation and evaluation of preventive and/or treatment interventions addressing health issues in SGM populations.</li>    <li>Research on how family structures and processes-including both families of origin and families of choice-affect the health of SGM individuals and their family members, including whether and how being raised in a family headed by SGM individuals affects the health, development, and well-being of children.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p class=""regulartext"">Research should be designed so that it is readily discernable whether the findings from the study sample can be generalized to other populations.&nbsp; Applicants should provide a precise description of the target population and of the sampling methods to be employed, paying attention not only to sexual behavior, identity, orientation, and gender characteristics, but to such variables as age, generational cohort, race/ethnicity, culture, geography, socioeconomic status, and physical and psychological qualities.&nbsp; Given the diversity of SGM populations, and their unknown distribution in the general population, it is expected that most projects will focus on one or a few well-defined groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Proposed research may draw from the full range of approaches within biological, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences, including both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Applicants are encouraged to build on and/or incorporate approaches and findings from research on other types of health disparities and from research on the influences of sex and gender in biological and behavioral functioning. Proposed research projects must consider the potential risks to and vulnerability of research participants and must ensure their confidentiality and protection. The ethical and legal implications of the proposed research on SGM populations must be considered. While the primary domain of interest is populations within the United States, research with non-U.S. populations is acceptable if the applicant can demonstrate the proposed work will contribute to scientific understanding of U.S. SGM populations.</p>; <div class=""heading2""><strong>Award Information</strong></div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Funding Instrument</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p class=""regulartext"">Grant: A support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Application Types Allowed</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p class=""regulartext"">New&nbsp;<br />Resubmission&nbsp;<br />Revision</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">The&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11116"">OER Glossary</a>&nbsp;and the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide provide details on these application types.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Clinical Trial?</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p class=""regulartext"">Optional: Accepting applications that either propose or do not propose clinical trial(s)</p>    <p class=""regulartext""><a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=82370"">Need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?</a></p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Funds Available and Anticipated Number of Awards</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p class=""regulartext"">The number of awards is contingent upon NIH appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Award Budget</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p class=""regulartext"">The combined budget for direct costs for the two year project period may not exceed $275,000.

Some organizations use the term vulvodynia to indicate vulvar pain of unknown etiology for more than 3 months.&nbsp; For the purposes of this announcement, vulvodynia and vulvar pain will be used interchangeably.&nbsp; The overall incidence of vulvodynia has been reported as 4.2 cases per 100 person-years in one population based study, with others estimating that persistent vulvar pain affects 9 to 18 percent of women at some point during their lifetime. Current evidence suggests that incidence rates vary by age, ethnicity and marital status.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Vulvodynia is associated with substantial morbidity including discomfort with physical activity such as sitting or walking, dyspareunia with resulting interference in intimate relationships, depression and anxiety, and an overall decrease in quality of life. Vulvar pain may be localized or generalized, provoked or spontaneous, intermittent or constant, and primary or secondary relative to first tampon insertion or first intercourse.&nbsp; Wide variations in age at presentation, pain characteristics, and clinical course are observed, with many patients experiencing episodic symptoms.&nbsp; Changes in the tissue of the vulva across the menstrual cycle, through the perimenopause, and in the menopause may be important contributors to persistent vulvar pain syndromes.&nbsp; Vulvar pain may be referred from other parts of the body, such as the pelvis, back or hips, so differentiation from other pain disorders, including pelvic floor dysfunction is an important consideration.&nbsp;</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">The NIH has multiple ongoing efforts to enhance pain research, including establishment of the NIH Pain Consortium, which promotes collaboration across NIH Institutes and Centers with programs addressing pain syndromes.&nbsp; A new Federal Pain plan will incorporate research and public input into furthering collaborations addressed at pain research.&nbsp; Research in vulvodynia is integrated into the broad spectrum of pain-related research at many Institutes and remains an important research area at NICHD, as it has for many years, yet our understanding of this complex, chronic pain syndrome remains incomplete.&nbsp; The development of the field of research, however, has matured and the depth of experience and breadth of collaborative interests now allow for future, strong multidisciplinary studies.&nbsp;</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">This FOA seeks collaborative, multidisciplinary projects which will foster novel approaches and avenues of research to expand the field of vulvodynia research.&nbsp; The inclusion of new investigators and new partnerships is encouraged in order to broaden the expertise applied to this challenging clinical problem. As current understanding is limited, applications are sought in a wide array of topics. Proposed studies may be clinical, translational and/or basic science in nature. Applications with an epidemiologic component should justify the use of this method to lay the groundwork for future translational or clinical studies. Genetic, hormonal, immunologic, inflammatory, microbial, neurophysiologic, behavioral, environmental, and/or psychosocial factors may contribute to the development of vulvodynia.&nbsp; The relationship between localized and general vulvodynia is also of continued interest.&nbsp; Study of these factors alone or in combination with other contributors such as severity, treatment response and/or long term sequelae will require multi-disciplinary approaches.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">There is a need for continued basic foundational research to fully inform clinical trials that will result in Level 1 evidence for clinical application, research, and professional societies.&nbsp; Determination of the effectiveness of risk factor modification for prevention of vulvodynia or the minimization of recurrence has yet to be fully explored.&nbsp; Potential differences in risk factors within and across racial and ethnic populations, and in different age groups including adolescents, is an important research area. The development of rigorous diagnostic criteria, including the identification of factors at the gene, molecular, protein, and cellular levels, will be a key area of research.&nbsp; As neuroimaging techniques become more widespread, innovative application of MRI functional studies and PET to define altered central pain pathways is newly possible. &nbsp;Research evidence is lacking to inform the development of guidelines for vulvodynia by multiple medical disciplines.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">An understanding of the relationship between pelvic floor disorders and other comorbidities which alter the pain threshold or act as triggers in the vulvar area is an area of interest.&nbsp; This can include potential common underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms between vulvodynia and other chronic pain disorders, such as temporomandibular joint disorder, interstitial cystitis, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, headache, as well as chronic fatigue syndrome; however, vulvodynia or chronic vulvar pain must be the primary focus of the application.&nbsp; Likewise, vulvar dystrophies, pathologic vaginal microbial or viral agents, or altered vaginal flora may be critical triggers in the development of vulvodynia but neither the tissue abnormality nor the infectious approach itself should&nbsp; be the focus of proposed studies submitted to this FOA.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Research topics relevant to this program announcement include, but are not limited to:</p>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Prospective clinical treatment trials, considering factorial designs, for well-described pharmacologic, surgical, behavioral, and/or physical therapy treatments utilizing strong multidisciplinary teams;</li>    <li>Investigations of&nbsp; the role of nerve damage, regional autonomic dysfunction, muscle instability, and/or tissue disruption and repair on the development, severity, persistence,&nbsp; or resistance to therapy of vulvodynia;</li>    <li>Development of surrogate animal models to assess the mechanism of vulvodynia formation or as potential pathways to screen for candidate therapeutic agents; &nbsp;</li>    <li>Rigorous laboratory studies to identify and characterize genetic and/or epigenetic processes involved in well-delineated vulvar pain conditions which may include generation of tissue banks with detailed phenotypes for use in genome-wide analyses or other types of genetic studies;</li>    <li>Identification and validation of biomarkers that may be used to diagnose disease, predict disease development or progression, and stratify patient subsets or response to therapy.&nbsp; This can include investigating biomarkers at the molecular, gene/protein and cell level. Development of biomarkers may also afford examination of smaller well-delineated groups for targeted treatment approaches;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>    <li>Prospective questionnaire development and validation using standardized techniques that effectively address research domains that cross the spectrum of potential risk factors, racial-ethnic groups, and ages that meet criteria for submission to the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS).</li>    </ul>    </ol>;

Given the expressed need to bring those trained in quantitative disciplines to neuroscience research, applications from individuals obtaining terminal doctorates in quantitative disciplines are encouraged.</p>    <p>For BRAIN Initiative awards to date, see&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/funding/fundedAwards.htm"">http://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/funding/fundedAwards.htm</a>.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Specific Objectives of this FOA</strong></div>    <p>The integrated program of research and training supported by this FOA is intended for postdoctorates who are early in their postdoctoral training period in a given laboratory or research environment, rather than for advanced postdoctorates. Support for early postdoctoral training will maximize the training potential of this fellowship award. Given the interval when applications will be accepted (from 12 months prior to completing terminal degree requirements to 12 months after starting postdoctoral training), it is recognized that some applicants are unlikely to have had the opportunity to generate preliminary data for the proposed project. Accordingly, it is expected that there will be no preliminary data in the application, although inclusion of preliminary data is permissible. &nbsp;</p>    <p>The proposed research and training plan should focus on a research area and/or skill set that clearly and strongly complements the applicant's existing research expertise and skills and that will markedly broaden the applicant's knowledge and skills. For example, an applicant with existing skills in molecular neuroscience might propose a research training plan that emphasizes circuit-level neuroscience approaches to brain function. An applicant with existing neuroscience training might propose a research training plan that emphasizes neuroethics. An applicant trained in physics or statistics might propose a research training plan that emphasizes data-intensive/computational approaches to neuroscience. An applicant with research experience using non-human vertebrate animals might propose a research training plan using human subjects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p>The application should consist of a well-conceived scientific project, integrated with a comprehensive training plan, which is designed by a collaborative discussion between the applicant fellow and sponsor. In addition to preparing the candidate to be a subject matter expert in the proposed research area and to acquire new technical skills, the research and training plans are expected to provide the candidate with a strong understanding of the principles of experimental design and the tools for rigorous analytical approaches. Given that neuroethics research may involve analysis of large qualitative data sets, applicants proposing research in this domain are expected to propose didactics and training that will develop state-of-the-art analytical skills appropriate for such data sets. In contrast, applicants proposing experimental neuroscience research and/or modeling are expected to propose didactics and training that will enable them to develop state-of-the-art quantitative skills, the principles of quantitative analysis, and to incorporate quantitative approaches that are appropriate to answer the proposed research question. Applicants proposing a computational/modeling project are encouraged to gain exposure to the biological approaches from which the data sets they'll model are derived.</p>    <p>Further, the proposed research and training plan should enhance the individual's potential to develop into a productive, independent researcher by providing committed mentorship, appropriate training and career development opportunities, and strong institutional support. The training plan should document the need for, and the anticipated value of, the proposed mentored training in relationship to the individual's research career goals and the individual's prior research training. The training plan should be explicitly designed to prepare the fellow to transition to the next stage of his/her research career.</p>    <p>It is expected that the mentored training experience will provide:</p>    <ul>    <li>A strong foundation in quantitative reasoning, research design, methods, statistics and analytic techniques appropriate to the proposed research and sufficient to ensure that the applicant has the knowledge and skills to generate robust and reproducible data;</li>    <li>Experience conducting research using appropriate, state-of-the-art tools and approaches relevant to the goals of the BRAIN Initiative, and an expert understanding of the tools and methods used;</li>    <li>Opportunities to present research findings at national meetings as the work progresses;</li>    <li>Opportunities to publish the research findings as first author;</li>    <li>Opportunities to interact with members of the scientific community at appropriate scientific meetings and workshops including BRAIN Initiative investigator meetings; and</li>    <li>Professional skills needed to transition to the next stage of the applicant's research career.</li>    </ul>    <p>To be considered responsive to this FOA, the proposed research training plan must be relevant to the scientific goals of the BRAIN 2025 Report, as described in the required Other Attachment for this application (see&nbsp;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/hamlettbt/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/vantveerav/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/RQ1HOBKH/BRAIN_F32_#_SF424(R&amp;R)_Other_Project"">Section IV.2.

The sponsoring institution must have staff and facilities available on site to provide a suitable environment for performing high-quality research training. The training should occur in an environment that has appropriate human and technical resources and is demonstrably committed to training in the field(s) proposed by the applicant. The sponsoring institution may be private (profit or nonprofit) or public, including the NIH Intramural Programs and other Federal laboratories. All institutions with the appropriate resources and commitment are encouraged to apply.</p>    <p>An individual may request support for training abroad. In such cases, the applicant is required to provide detailed justification for the foreign training, including the reasons why the facilities, the sponsor, or other aspects of the proposed experience are more appropriate than training in a domestic setting. The justification is evaluated in terms of the scientific advantages of the foreign training as compared to the training available domestically. Foreign training will be considered for funding only when the scientific advantages are clear.</p>    <p>The Kirschstein-NRSA F32 fellowship is designed to support research training experiences in new settings in order to maximize the acquisition of new skills and knowledge. In most cases, therefore, the sponsoring institution should be a site other than where the applicant trained as a graduate student. However, if the applicant is proposing postdoctoral training at his/her doctoral institution, the application must carefully document the opportunities for new research training experiences specifically designed to broaden his/her scientific background and to acquire new knowledge and/or technical skills that will enhance his/her potential to become a productive, independent investigator. Applications that propose postdoctoral experiences in the same lab, in fundamentally the same research environment, or with the same primary mentor who supported the candidate's predoctoral experience, are inconsistent with the intent of this F32 program.</p>    <div class=""heading4"">Foreign Institutions</div>    <p>Non-domestic (non-U.S.) Entities (Foreign Institutions)&nbsp;<strong>are&nbsp;</strong>eligible to apply.&nbsp;<br />Non-domestic (non-U.S.) components of U.S. Organizations&nbsp;<strong>are&nbsp;</strong>eligible to apply.<br />Foreign components, as&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11118"">defined in the&nbsp;<em>NIH Grants Policy Statement</em></a>,&nbsp;<strong>are&nbsp;</strong>allowed.</p>"922,Open Opp,"Innovative Questions in Symptom Science and Genomics    : <div class=""heading4""><strong><a name=""_Toc258873267""></a>Background</strong></div>    <p class=""regulartext"">The Innovative Questions initiative began the next stage in the implementation of NINR&rsquo;s Strategic Plan.&nbsp; The initiative was designed to develop lists of creative scientific questions that promote results-oriented research, and that can guide NINR- supported science over the next 5 to 10 years.&nbsp; To meet this goal, NINR engaged their community of scientists and other stakeholders in open discussion as to what areas of investigation are worth pursuing.&nbsp; The outcome of this expert dialogue was the generation of specific innovative questions which pose promise for new paradigms and clinical approaches for transformative programs of research that push the limits to advance nursing science.

Pain often results in disability and, even when not disabling, it has a profound effect on the quality of life. &nbsp;Its deleterious effects have been demonstrated in morbidity, immune function, sleep, cognition, eating, mobility, affective state, psychosocial behaviors, and overall functional status. &nbsp;In the hospitalized patient, pain may be associated with increased length of stay, longer recovery time, and poorer patient outcomes, which in turn have health care quality and cost implications.</p>    <p>The NIH Pain Consortium was established in 1996 to enhance pain research and promote collaboration among researchers across the many NIH ICs that have programs and activities addressing pain. Currently, the research interests of twenty-one NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices are represented in the Consortium. &nbsp;Although these combined efforts have resulted in great scientific progress, the understanding and treatment of pain remains incomplete.&nbsp; In 2011, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released its report, ""Relieving Pain in America"", which outlined the state of pain prevention, care, and research, and provided a blueprint to guide efforts to transform pain care in the United States.&nbsp; The core recommendations of the IOM report led to development of the National Pain Strategy (NPS), which was released by HHS in 2016.&nbsp; The NPS outlines the federal government&rsquo;s first coordinated plan for reducing the burden of chronic pain that affects millions of Americans. &nbsp;NIH is responsive to and in alignment with the NPS and the IOM report, and continues to be committed to supporting research to advance the scientific understanding of pain and the treatments available to those suffering in pain.</p>    <p>The NIH Pain Consortium supports research on all conditions in which pain is a prominent feature. &nbsp;Of interest are diseases, such as cancer, that of themselves or their treatment may result in pain. &nbsp;Many primary conditions, whether acute (such as injury), recurring (such as migraine), or chronic (such as arthritis) are significantly complicated by co-morbid pain disorders. &nbsp;Some pain conditions are unassociated with other primary diagnoses. &nbsp;Chronic pain is widely believed to represent a disease itself, causing long-term detrimental physiologic changes and requiring unique assessments and treatments. The areas of research detailed below and the following acute and chronic pain conditions are of special interest but do not comprise a comprehensive or complete listing of research areas relevant to this FOA.</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Inflammatory Pain</li>    <li>Visceral pain</li>    <li>Chronic urologic pelvic pain syndromes</li>    <li>Neuropathic pain</li>    <li>Spinal cord injury pain</li>    <li>Headache</li>    <li>Musculoskeletal pain, including back pain</li>    <li>Cancer related pain (e.g. pain due to metastasis or primary disease)</li>    <li>Cardiovascular pain disorders</li>    <li>Chemotherapy-induced neuropathies and other related toxicities&nbsp; (e.g. aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgias).</li>    <li>Fibromyalgia</li>    <li>Temporomandibular joint and muscle disorders</li>    <li>Pain associated with HIV/AIDS</li>    <li>Pain associated with osteoporosis</li>    <li>Pain associated with communication disorders (e.g., otitis media, tinnitus, burning mouth syndrome, dysphagia)</li>    <li>Pain at the end of life</li>    <li>Pain in older persons with multiple chronic conditions</li>    <li>Pain in people with drug and alcohol addictions</li>    <li>Pain in persons with neuromuscular conditions</li>    <li>Pain in preterm neonates exposed to multiple medical interventions and/or procedures</li>    <li>Skin disorders and pain</li>    <li>Orofacial pain</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives</strong></p>    <p>The R21 mechanism is intended to encourage new exploratory and developmental research projects. For example, such projects could assess the feasibility of a novel area of investigation or a new experimental system that has the potential to enhance health-related research. Another example could include the unique and innovative use of an existing methodology to explore a new scientific area. These studies may involve considerable risk but may lead to a breakthrough in a particular area, or to the development of novel techniques, agents, methodologies, models, or applications that could have a major impact on a field of biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research.</p>    <p>Applications for R21 awards should describe projects distinct from those supported through the traditional R01 mechanism. For example, long-term projects, or projects designed to increase knowledge in a well-established area, will not be considered for R21 awards. Applications submitted under this mechanism should be exploratory and novel. These studies should break new ground or extend previous discoveries toward new directions or applications.</p>    <p>New and innovative advances are needed in every area of pain research, from the microperspective of molecular sciences to the macro perspective of behavioral/social sciences. &nbsp;Although great strides have been made in some areas, such as the neural pathways of pain, chronic pain and the challenge of its treatment have remained uniquely individual and largely unsolved. &nbsp;Applications that seek to improve the understanding of the causes, costs, and societal effects of both acute and chronic pain and the relationships between the two are highly encouraged. Studies on the mechanisms underlying the transition from acute to chronic pain are also needed. &nbsp;Additionally, applications that link such understandings to the development of better approaches to therapeutic interventions, including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions, and self-management of acute and chronic pain are in keeping with the current translational focus of NIH and are encouraged.</p>    <p>The following topic areas are not intended to be comprehensive or exhaustive. &nbsp;Synergistic studies that reach across two or more of these areas are encouraged. &nbsp;Interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research is especially encouraged, as is research that involves specific cooperation between basic and clinical scientists, incorporates longitudinal and innovative clinical trial designs, and uses comparative effectiveness research techniques. These pain research areas also cut across ICs and programs and should not be viewed as restricted to only one specific IC.</p>; <div class=""heading2""><strong>Award Information</strong></div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Funding Instrument</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>Grant: A support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Application Types Allowed</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>New&nbsp;<br />Resubmission&nbsp;</p>    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11116"">OER Glossary</a>&nbsp;and the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide provide details on these application types.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Clinical Trial?</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p class=""regulartext"">Optional: Accepting applications that either propose or do not propose clinical trial(s)</p>    <p class=""regulartext""><a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=82370"">Need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?</a></p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Funds Available and Anticipated Number of Awards</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>The number of awards is contingent upon NIH appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Award Budget</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>Direct costs are limited to $275,000 over an R21 two-year period, with no more than $200,000 in direct costs allowed in any single year.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Award Project Period</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>The scope of the proposed project should determine the project period.&nbsp;

The over-arching goals of the NIH R25 program are to: (1) complement and/or enhance the training of a workforce to meet the nation&rsquo;s biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs; (2) enhance the diversity of the biomedical, behavioral and clinical research workforce; (3) help recruit individuals with specific specialty or disciplinary backgrounds to research careers in biomedical, behavioral and clinical sciences; and (4) foster a better understanding of biomedical, behavioral and clinical research and its implications.</p>    <p>The over-arching goal of this&nbsp; NINDS&nbsp; R25 program is to support educational activities that&nbsp;&nbsp; complement and/or enhance the training of a workforce to meet the nation&rsquo;s biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To accomplish the stated over-arching goal, this FOA will support creative educational activities with a primary focus on:</p>    <ul>    <li><strong>Research Experiences:</strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;As the primary goal of this R25 program is to provide participants with the skills, education and experience needed to successfully compete for individual research funding, the following formal training components should be considered critical for this program: experimental design, statistical methodology that is specifically tailored to the applicant's needs, grant writing and presentation skills. Training in the responsible conduct of research is expected. Other than for these specific purposes, or for those participating in a Ph.D.-granting program, it is expected that participants will engage in little or no coursework while participating in this research education program. Supported activities should be restricted to those that will directly aid the participant in developing a significant research project and the skills that will allow them to obtain individual research funding for this project.</li>    <li>Courses for Skills Development: It is expected that participants of the NINDS R25 will attend and participate in the annual R25 workshop specific to this FOA. This workshop will bring together the participants (typically neurologists, neurosurgeons and neuropathologists) in this program to discuss the transition from residency and fellowship to successful competition for individual research career development and research awards. The workshop will feature lectures from both junior and established researchers, including some who have recently transitioned to career development awards. The meeting will also include sessions that are individualized for each specialty, small group breakout sessions and many opportunities for networking and mentoring. All residents and fellows in attendance will also present a poster of their on-going or planned research during the workshop and discuss their planned, next submission specific aims with designated mentors.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>    </ul>    <p class=""Bullet""><strong>Overview of this NINDS &nbsp;Research&nbsp;Education&nbsp;Program</strong></p>    <p class=""Bullet"">There is critical need for additional physician-scientists with the medical training and research experience to conduct basic, clinical and translational research on the mechanisms, cure and treatment of neurological disorders. NINDS provides mentored career development awards (K08 and K23 mechanisms) to highly qualified physician-scientists who have early training and experience in research, and who generally have one or more significant, original research publications.&nbsp; However, there is need for a mechanism to support the early education of clinicians during the residency/fellowship period, which will help them develop a highly significant research project and research-related skills that are needed to compete successfully for the mentored career development awards. Moreover, earlier education in the development of a research program will speed the transition from residency to K award, and consequently from mentored to independent research position. This Research Education Program is designed to foster the development of clinician-scientists through research and educational experiences, and prepare clinicians to successfully compete for individual NIH mentored career development awards in neuroscientific research areas.</p>    <p class=""Bullet"">It is expected that participants will conduct basic, clinical or translational research in a well-funded (NIH or comparable) research laboratory and have one or more mentors with a superb track record in the training of future scientists. In addition, it is expected that participants will receive education in the non-research tools and skills necessary for a successful transition to an individual award. Hallmarks of these programs will be the immersion of participants in a significant research problem and an environment that provides high quality mentoring in all aspects of research and career development required for success as a physician-scientist. The immediate goal of this program is to prepare clinicians to successfully compete for individual mentored career development awards. Such success will facilitate their transition from resident/fellow to independent physician-scientist, and thus foster contributions to research into the mechanisms, etiology, and treatment of neurological diseases by investigators with a profound clinical knowledge of those diseases.</p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent"">Participants are expected to apply for individual funding (either a mentored career development award (NIH K equivalent) or individual research grant (NIH R01 equivalent)) by the end of their involvement in this research education program.</p>    <p class=""Bullet""><strong>Research Education Program&nbsp;Structure</strong></p>    <p class=""Bullet"">Applications will be accepted for this funding opportunity announcement from accredited Medical Schools and/or residency programs that propose outstanding opportunities for residents and fellows (&ldquo;participants&rdquo;) to participate in an intensive, mentored research education experience during residency and fellowship training. Although it is anticipated that most participants will be in Neurology, Neurosurgery, Neuropathology, Neuroradiology, Anesthesiology or Emergency Medicine, residents and fellows from other subspecialties may participate as long as the mentors and participants are conducting research clearly within the mission of NINDS. The PD/PIs, as well as program leadership, must have a full time faculty appointment at a Medical School and be a member of a Neurology, Neurosurgery or Pathology Department or Program.</p>    <p class=""Bullet"">Participating residents and fellows must be supported for a minimum of 9 months, and may be supported up to a maximum of 36 months (up to 72 months for those enrolled in Ph.D.-granting programs by the start of the first fellowship year). Support occurs in increments. Each increment (or period) of funding occurs between July 1 and June 30, in order to coincide with clinical schedules. The first increment of funding, which must occur during residency, may be for 6 to 12 months in duration. A second increment of funding may be requested for support during a fellowship year (or where applicable, a 2nd residency year). The duration of the second period of support, combined with the duration of the first period of support, must total a minimum of 18 months. A third and final increment of support may be requested for an additional fellowship year. Thus, up to 24 months of support may be obtained during fellowship years (up to 60 months for those enrolled in a Ph.D.-granting program). However, to obtain more than 18 months of post-residency support by this R25 program, participants must submit a competitive, individual mentored K award application within the first 18 months of&nbsp; R25 support (within the first 30 months for those enrolled in a Ph.D.-granting program). A typical, but not required, support path, might be 6 months during residency, then 12 months during a first fellowship year and 12 months during a second fellowship year. In this example, the last 6 months of support &nbsp;would be contingent on submission of a high quality, individual mentored K award application during the first 18 months of post-residency R25 support.</p>    <p class=""Bullet"">During any supported period, participants must devote 80% of full-time professional effort (e.g. during a 12 month supported period, this would equal 9.6 person months) to this research education program. This 80% commitment by the participant should occupy 4 full days during the Monday through Friday workweek.&nbsp; In general, supported time during residency should include at least one block of time with a minimum continuous duration of 6 months. Support during residency may occur during a single Post-Graduate Year (PGY) or in a contiguous period split between two PGY years.</p>    <p class=""Bullet"">This effort requirement also applies to neurosurgery residents. However, neurosurgeons may commit a minimum of 6 person-months (50%) full-time professional effort to the program after having had a total of 12 months of R25 support at 80% effort. This is consistent with the Career Development (K) award accommodation that allows neurosurgeons to devote a minimum of 50% of full-time professional effort to research while supported by a K award.</p>    <p class=""Bullet"">A one to two year gap in time between the first and second increment of support is acceptable if the gap is required to obtain additional clinical training during residency or fellowship. Research activity between a second and third period of support must be continuous. Although support is intended to be provided during residency and fellowship periods, funds may be used for those in faculty positions if this period of support immediately follows a residency or fellowship period of support.</p>    <p class=""Bullet"">In addition to the on-site research education participants will receive, they are expected to attend national and/or international meetings to present their work and network with other researchers in their fields. In addition, participants are expected to attend a special NINDS workshop designed for this program once for each increment of funding that they receive.</p>    <p class=""Bullet"">The structure of the research education program at each institution will be unique and should maximize resources and faculty at the applicant institution. All programs should include extensive laboratory and/or clinical research experience, including the collection of data that can be used by the participant in an application for independent funding. All participants should be thoroughly educated in fundamental&nbsp;concepts of experimental design and analysis, and scientific rigor (for details, see&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-NS-11-023.html"">NOT-NS-11-023</a>&nbsp;and the related&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/grant_policy.htm"">NINDS Grants Policy statement</a>). As the primary goal of this R25 program is to provide participants with the skills and experience needed to successfully compete for individual research funding, grant writing and presentation skills should be treated as critical components of the program. &nbsp;Formal activities to hone these skills should occur at the R25 institution and will include the R25 workshop.&nbsp; Training in the responsible conduct of research is required for all participants. Other than for these specific purposes, or if enrolled in a Ph.D.-granting program (see below), it is expected that participants will engage in little or no coursework while participating in this research education program. Supported activities should be restricted to those that will directly aid the participant in developing a significant research project and the skills that will allow them to obtain individual research funding for this project.</p>    <p class=""Bullet"">R25 programs may focus on research education applicable to basic, clinical or, translational research, or any combination of these three, depending on their area(s) of research strength. Applicants are encouraged to clearly explain the reasoning and goals behind the choice of program focus.</p>    <p class=""Bullet""><strong>Potential for additional participants</strong>. It is anticipated that R25 programs will have one outstanding participant per year. However, NINDS recognizes that, in any given year, programs may have more than one highly qualified candidate for R25 support. Programs can request support for additional participants via an administrative supplement request, using a specific companion FOA (see&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-17-442.html"">PA-17-442</a>&nbsp;or subsequent reissue).</p>    <p class=""Bullet""><strong>Participant enrollment in a Ph.D.-granting program.</strong>&nbsp;Participants who have a clinical doctorate, but not a research doctorate, may wish to enroll in a Ph.D.-granting program during the R25 period. Whereas clinicians can obtain outstanding research education and experiences without a research doctorate, obtaining the research doctorate can provide educational opportunities, as well as outstanding research credentials and skills, not easily obtained without one. Participants may be supported by this R25 if simultaneously enrolled in a Ph.D.-granting program as long as the goals, research and educational activities of the two programs are overlapping, and the goals of the R25 research education program are met. Participants simultaneously enrolled in a Ph.D.-granting program may be supported by this R25 for up to 5 years post-residency. As with all participants, support is provided on a yearly basis.</p>    <p class=""Bullet""><strong>Participation in an NINDS sponsored workshop for R25 residents and fellows.</strong>&nbsp;As part of this research education experience, all participants are expected to attend an NINDS-sponsored workshop for R25 residents and fellows. Funds are provided in this award specifically for attendance at this workshop (additional details about this workshop will be provided yearly by the&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:korns@ninds.nih.gov"">NINDS Director of Training and Workforce Development</a>). Acceptance of funding by the PD/PI for participants is made with the understanding that supported participants will attend this workshop. The PD/PI(s) are encouraged to attend this workshop whenever possible, as their participation in all aspects of the program are critical to its success.</p>    <p class=""Bullet""><strong>Participants must begin this program during residency.</strong>&nbsp;This research education grant is intended to provide a means for participants to begin research education during residency and, if appropriate, continue this education during their fellowship period. Consequently, support for any individual participant must begin during residency. Participants must commit 80% effort (4 full days during the Monday through Friday workweek) for a minimum period of 6 months (6 months at 80% effort = 4.8 person-months) during residency to be eligible for continued support during a fellowship period.</p>    <p class=""Bullet""><strong>Evaluation of program success.</strong>&nbsp;The primary indicator of success of these programs will be the ability of participants to 1) successfully compete for individual, NIH career development awards or equivalent individual awards or fellowships, and 2) in the long term, continue their research career beyond the career development stage. It is anticipated that many applicants will publish original research papers that result from work done during this research education period, and in addition, many will obtain academic faculty positions. However, the most important outcome of this R25 research education program will be the successful competition for major individual funding for continued research and/or research career development by the participants. Programs will be evaluated primarily on the success of participants in obtaining individual funding and secondarily on progress made by its participants towards this goal.</p>    <p class=""Bullet""><strong>Transfer of support to other institutions with similar R25 programs.</strong>&nbsp;In some cases, participants who begin a research education program during residency may wish to change institutions for fellowship training. If the proposed fellowship training institution has an R25 program supported by this FOA, residents and fellows may continue their research education program at this new institution.</p>    <p class=""Bullet"">Prospective applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:korns@ninds.nih.gov"">NINDS Director of Training and Workforce Development</a>&nbsp;early in the application preparation phase to discuss award provisions.&nbsp; Such contact can help ensure that applications reflect the aims expressed in this announcement.</p>    <p><a name=""_Toc258873267""></a>Research education programs may complement ongoing research training and education occurring at the applicant institution, but the proposed educational experiences must be distinct from those training and education programs currently receiving Federal support.

Applications should provide resources for evaluating the feasibility, tolerability, acceptability and safety of approaches to improving mental health or functional outcomes, or modifying risk factors, and for obtaining the preliminary data needed as a pre-requisite to a larger-scale effectiveness trial (e.g., pragmatic trial) or large-scale services intervention study.&nbsp;In this pilot phase of intervention and services research, NIMH places highest priority on approaches that can be justified in terms of their potential to substantially impact practice and public health (i.e., in terms of the magnitude of likely improvements in clinical benefit, safety/tolerability profile, value and efficiency, or scalability potential, as compared to existing approaches) and are empirically grounded.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Adaptations or augmentations of efficacious preventive, therapeutic, or services interventions should only be undertaken if there is (a) an empirical rationale for the adaptation/augmentation&nbsp; target (i.e., a clear association of the adaptation/augmentation with non-response, partial response, patient non-engagement, or relapse), (b) a clear hypothesis and plan to address the mechanism by which the adapted intervention or augmentation will enhance outcomes, and (c) evidence to suggest that the adapted intervention will result in a substantial improvement in response rate, speed of response, an aspect of care, or uptake in community/practice settings.</p>    <p>Consistent with the NIMH experimental therapeutics approach (<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2012/experimental-medicine.shtml"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2012/experimental-medicine.shtml</a>),&nbsp; this FOA is intended to support pilot tests of intervention effectiveness or service delivery approaches that explicitly address whether the intervention engages the target(s)/mechanism(s) presumed to underlie the intervention effects (i.e., the mechanism that accounts for changes in clinical/functional outcomes, changes in provider behavior, improved access or continuity of services, etc.).&nbsp; The goal is to re-confirm whether the intervention targets and the associated change mechanisms previously identified under more controlled efficacy conditions are operative in the effectiveness context.&nbsp;In this manner, the results of the pilot effectiveness trial will advance knowledge regarding therapeutic change mechanisms and inform decisions about whether further effectiveness testing is warranted (see&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/clinical-trials-for-researchers/index.shtml"">NIMH web page on Clinical Trials</a>).</p>    <p>Depending on the nature of preventive and therapeutic interventions, the intervention ""targets"" and change mechanisms might involve specific psychological or behavioral processes (e.g., attention bias, cognitive control, stress regulation) or neurobiological entities (e.g., brain circuits). This R34 FOA supports pilot effectiveness studies focused on refining and optimizing preventive and therapeutic interventions with previously demonstrated efficacy for use with broader target populations or for use in community practice settings in anticipation of fully-powered trials (e.g., practical trials).&nbsp;With appropriate justification, there could be an exception to the requirement for efficacy evidence before an intervention is tested in an effectiveness context. For example, to reduce the alarming fall-off in effect sizes from efficacy to effectiveness studies, and to expedite translation from intervention development to practice-ready interventions, this FOA can be used to conduct pilot trials in community settings as early as possible following a demonstration of efficacy.&nbsp;Researchers interested in novel intervention development that is explicitly focused on the initial translation of neurobiological, basic cognitive and behavioral science findings into novel interventions are referred to the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/clinical-trials-for-researchers/index.shtml"">NIMH web page on Clinical Trials.</a></p>    <p>This FOA is also intended to support research on the development and preliminary testing of innovative&nbsp;services interventions. Targets/mechanisms for such services interventions might involve mutable consumer- or provider- behaviors, or organizational-/system- level factors that are intervened upon in order to improve access, continuity, quality, equity, and/or value of services.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>    <p>Valid and reliable measures of change in the hypothesized target(s)/mechanism(s) will provide useful information about key change mechanisms that account for intervention effects. In the assessment of target engagement, NIMH encourages the use of measures that are as direct and objective as is feasible in the effectiveness setting. Specifically encouraged are empirically validated measures of the construct that extend beyond self-reports and other subjective measures, where possible, and inclusion of measures that span more than one level of assessment if possible and appropriate.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Effective prevention and treatment of mental illness have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with intentional injury&nbsp;(i.e., suicide attempts and deaths, see:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.suicide-research-agenda.org/"">www.suicide-research-agenda.org</a>).&nbsp;Lack of attention to the assessment of these outcomes has limited our understanding regarding the degree to which effective mental health interventions might offer prophylaxis. Accordingly, where feasible and appropriate, NIMH encourages effectiveness research that includes assessment of suicidal behavior in clinical trials in response to this FOA&nbsp;using strategies that can facilitate integration and sharing of data (e.g., see&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-15-009.html"">NOT-MH-15-009</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title=""Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"" href=""https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/"">https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/</a>&nbsp;for constructs and corresponding assessment strategies).</p>    <p>For multi-site trials, use of single IRBs is expected.</p>    <p>Potential applicants are strongly encouraged to contact&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-16-410.html#_Section_VII._Agency"">Scientific/Research contacts</a>&nbsp;as far in advance as possible<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to discuss the potential clinical practice/public health impact of the proposed pilot investigation, as well as concordance with current NIMH priorities.</p>    <p>Information about the mission, strategic plan and research interests of the NIMH can be found at the NIMH website (<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/</a>) including&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/strategic-research-priorities/index.shtml"">https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/strategic-research-priorities/index.shtml</a>.&nbsp;Applicants are also strongly encouraged to review the information on the NIMH website focused on clinical trials&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas/index.shtml"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/clinical-trials-for-researchers/index.shtml.</a></p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Scope of Pilot Research</strong></div>    <p>Pilot effectiveness studies in response to this announcement should propose the developmental work that would justify and inform the design of a subsequent randomized controlled trial (RCT) or a highly rigorous trial in community treatment settings where randomization is not possible. Pilot trials&nbsp;should be explicitly designed to enhance the probability of obtaining meaningful results in subsequent well-powered trials by including measures of action (i.e., assessment of presumed mechanisms, such as specific neurobiological entities (e.g., brain circuits) or psychological or behavioral processes (e.g., attention bias, cognitive control, stress regulation)) that are presumed to underlie the intervention effects and account for changes in clinical/functional outcomes, changes in provider behavior, systems level improvements, etc., as appropriate and feasible in the effectiveness context. For studies that involve preventive or therapeutic interventions, as appropriate, the study should take into account RDoC or RDoC-like constructs when defining the subject eligibility (inclusion), intervention targets or mechanisms, and outcomes (see the RDoC webpage&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-funding/rdoc/nimh-research-domain-criteria-rdoc.shtml"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-funding/rdoc/nimh-research-domain-criteria-rdoc.shtml</a>&nbsp;for more details).&nbsp;In this manner, pilot study results &ndash; whether positive or negative &ndash; will provide information of high utility to the field by informing decisions about whether further testing is warranted and by advancing knowledge regarding therapeutic change mechanisms.</p>    <p>This pilot FOA also affords an opportunity to refine and pilot test the experimental protocols, including the assessment protocol, the experimental intervention protocol (e.g., the manual for a psychosocial intervention, the dosing schedule for a psychosocial or pharmacological approach), and the comparison intervention protocol and randomization procedures (if appropriate); to examine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants into the study conditions (including the experimental condition and the comparison condition, if relevant); and to explore the feasibility of delivering the intervention with the target population (e.g., a case series in a community practice setting).&nbsp;</p>    <p>Accordingly, collection of preliminary data regarding feasibility, acceptability, safety, tolerability, and target outcomes is appropriate.&nbsp;Given the intended pilot nature of the R34 mechanism, conducting formal tests of clinical outcomes or attempting to obtain an estimate of an effect size is often not justified.&nbsp;Given the limited sample sizes typically supportable under this pilot study mechanism, the variability in the effect sizes obtained is often so large as to be unreliable. Thus, using these potentially unstable effect size estimates in power calculations for larger studies, without regard to clinical meaningfulness, is not advisable.</p>; <div class=""heading2""><strong>&nbsp;Award Information</strong></div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Funding Instrument</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>Grant: A support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Application Types Allowed</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>New&nbsp;<br /><br />Resubmission from&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-16-410.html"">RFA-MH-16-410</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-17-612.html"">RFA-MH-17-612</a>&nbsp;and RFA-MH-18-706<br />Revision from&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-16-410.html"">RFA-MH-16-410</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-17-612.html"">RFA-MH-17-612</a>&nbsp;and RFA-MH-18-706</p>    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11116"">OER Glossary</a>&nbsp;and the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide provide details on these application types.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Clinical Trial?</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>Required: Only accepting applications that propose clinical trial(s)</p>    <p><a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=82370"">Need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?</a></p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Funds Available and Anticipated Number of Awards</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>NIMH intends to commit $18 million in direct costs for FY 2018 to fund this FOA and the companion FOAs listed in&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-18-706.html#_Companion_Funding_Opportunity"">Part 1.

The goal of the R21 mechanism is to provide flexibility for initiating exploratory, short-term studies, thus allowing new ideas to be investigated in a more expeditious manner without stringent requirements for preliminary data. Such support is needed to encourage investigators to pursue new approaches, underdeveloped topics, or more creative avenues for research including new partnerships. Epidemiological research with a goal of informing translational/clinical research on prevention or treatment of obesity or overweight in adults and/or children is encouraged. The emphasis is thus on the development of exploratory clinical studies, pilot and feasibility studies, or small randomized clinical trials that will provide preliminary data for intervention, and epidemiological studies that will inform translational/clinical research.</p>    <p>This initiative specifically encourages the submission of applications for pilot and feasibility or exploratory clinical studies related to obesity. These studies should focus on research that is particularly innovative and/or potentially of high impact. Innovative research includes feasibility studies in which the technological, methodological, or theoretical approach to a problem lacks historical precedent or sufficient preliminary data but is highly promising. High impact research involves studies where successful outcomes would have a major effect on the area of obesity. Clinical pilot and feasibility studies could provide the data needed to design appropriately powered efficacy studies. Such trials may use pharmacological, dietary supplement, dietary, surgical, medical device, physical activity, behavioral, or neuro-modulatory interventions aimed at prevention or treatment of obesity or overweight in adults and/or children. Applications to identify novel risk factors for the development of overweight and obesity and their complications are encouraged.</p>    <p><strong>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)</strong></p>    <p>For this FOA, NIDDK emphasizes interest in novel/innovative approaches that test for initial efficacy of obesity prevention/treatment interventions. Epidemiological studies including utility of electronic health records and targeted precision medicine approaches that will inform translational/clinical research are also of interest.&nbsp; Successful clinical studies supported under this funding mechanism that yield promising preliminary/pilot data are then expected to move forward to inform the design and implementation of adequately powered clinical trials, typically using the NIH R01 mechanism.&nbsp; Applications that target overweight/obesity prevention or treatment/management outcomes such as body mass index (BMI), body weight, and/or body composition across the lifespan are of particular interest. &nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</strong></p>    <p>Because obesity has been observed to be associated with increased incidence and mortality of certain cancers, including postmenopausal breast, pancreatic, ovarian, and colorectal cancer, among others, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) will participate in this initiative. The NCI believes it is particularly important to foster research to identify effective interventions for prevention and treatment of obesity, including novel energy intake and expenditure modalities that alter body weight and/or composition in certain subpopulations of cancer patients and those at high risk for cancer. Thus, the types of research applications which NCI is interested in supporting include pilot human intervention studies utilizing bioactive components (e.g., tea polyphenols, calcium), or variation in diet composition or dietary pattern strategies that evaluate weight change in populations of interest to NCI. Such populations might include individuals with a genetic propensity for cancer as well as those with cancer or those at risk for recurrence of cancer. Studies that target ethnic and minority populations are also encouraged. NCI is also interested in pilot intervention studies that examine the influence of weight loss/control on cancer related biomarkers.</p>    <p><strong>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)</strong></p>    <p>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is interested in clinical studies that accelerate interventions for the prevention or treatment of obesity in children, adolescents, or families.&nbsp; NICHD encourages multilevel interventions that target individual, family and socio-environmental factors related to overweight and obesity.&nbsp;Observational studies to identify behavioral, psychosocial, and/or environmental factors that motivate or promote adherence to healthy dietary and physical activity behaviors for obesity prevention or treatment are also of interest.&nbsp; Applications that focus on reducing health disparities as well as those focused on minority populations are particularly encouraged.&nbsp; The National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research (NCMRR) within NICHD is interested in approaches that address populations of individuals diagnosed with disabilities, both adults and children, primarily aimed at obesity prevention, physical activity participation, improved health status and reduction of secondary conditions. NCMRR encourages research that aims to better understand the special needs of children with disabilities, in order to develop integrated clinical and behavioral strategies to promote physical activity, reduce secondary conditions, foster healthy dietary choices, and improve health status and social participation.&nbsp;</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Objectives and Scope</strong></div>    <p>Studies on the prevention or treatment of overweight or obesity in children and/or adults, including dietary, physical activity, behavioral, psychosocial, neurocognitive and neuro-modulatory, pharmacologic, and surgical, and other biomedical approaches are of interest. The creative use of various devices, technologies, or communication strategies to help individuals monitor energy intake or energy expenditure in weight control programs would be appropriate. Innovative studies that test the synergy of creative partnerships among various groups such as industry, business, faith-based, academic, or community organizations to enhance obesity prevention or treatment outcomes are of interest. Studies of various approaches in combination to achieve weight maintenance or to maintain weight loss, such as physical activity or diet in combination with pharmacologic or surgical regimens would also be appropriate.</p>    <p>Basic laboratory research, studies that propose to use laboratory animals or stored bio-samples, and studies that do not involve human subjects are not appropriate for this announcement.

Such support is needed to encourage experienced investigators as well as new investigators to pursue new clinical or laboratory approaches, novel or underdeveloped topics, or more creative avenues of research.&nbsp; If successful, these awards should lead to significant scientific advances in digestive disease and nutrition research and should facilitate translation into improved understanding of disease pathophysiologic mechanisms or into clinical practice to improve patient outcomes.&nbsp; This FOA will permit both clinical and translational pilot and feasibility studies that involve human subjects research.&nbsp; The research proposed to this FOA should involve direct clinical studies in humans or studies on identifiable specimens from human subjects such as tissues, organoids, or biospecimens.&nbsp;</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Clinical pilot and feasibility studies: Potential clinical pilot and feasibility studies for this funding opportunity should be on diseases that ordinarily have little research support either because they are uncommon or rare, or difficult to manage, or are not the focus of pharmacological therapy.&nbsp; For instance, there are several digestive diseases that may have lasting and major consequences for the patients who have these conditions. These conditions are particularly challenging when they occur in children and have life-long consequences.&nbsp; These diseases are often too uncommon to be adequately investigated by a single individual or at a single medical research institution.&nbsp; For these reasons, ideally, the study of these conditions might be best performed by a consortium of investigators that come together with a common protocol to focus on natural history and clinical investigation rather than a specific therapeutic intervention. For the purposes of this FOA, the NIDDK limits multi-centered pilot and feasibility clinical studies or trials to just 2 clinical sites.&nbsp;</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Translational sciences pilot and feasibility studies: In addition to clinical pilot and feasibility studies noted above, further understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms that underpin the development of digestive, hepatic and nutritional associated diseases may shed light on furthering our understanding of the disease process and inform approaches to strategically envision rational therapeutic approaches.&nbsp; Innovative therapeutic approaches targeting key pathophysiologic mechanisms may advance the understanding of the digestive disease process and may pioneer the development of future diagnostics or therapeutics.&nbsp; Several liver, digestive and nutritional diseases would benefit from further delineation and advancement by more precisely defining the pathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to end-organ injury.&nbsp; Thus, translational sciences pilot and feasibility studies may yield improved understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms, candidate biomarkers, improved delineation of candidate gene functions in disease states, as examples of outcomes, but because of the pilot and feasibility nature of this FOA, are clearly not limited to just these examples.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Objectives and Scope</strong></div>    <p class=""regulartext"">This funding opportunity is intended to encourage pilot and feasibility clinical and laboratory based translational research relevant to the mission of the Division of Digestive Diseases and Nutrition, NIDDK without stringent requirements for preliminary data.&nbsp; Applications submitted to this FOA should propose research studies that will facilitate the translation of promising and relevant new developments into the clinical setting or that will advance our understanding of pathophysiological mechanism that may become the basis for diagnostic or therapeutic development.

This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) specifically encourages the submission of applications for small scale or pilot and feasibility clinical and translational research studies, including epidemiological studies or clinical trials related to kidney disease research that address important clinical and translational questions. It is anticipated that some applications for pilot and feasibility studies may lead to full-scale clinical studies including evaluation of diagnostic strategies, epidemiologic studies, or trials in the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of kidney diseases.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">These grants may be used to plan, evaluate the feasibility, or implement clinical trials that assess pharmacological, dietary, surgical, or behavioral interventions for the prevention or treatment of kidney disease.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">It is anticipated that applications submitted in response to this FOA will focus on kidney clinical studies.&nbsp;<strong>This FOA is intended to support research directly involving human participants</strong>. Basic laboratory research studies or studies of animals are not appropriate for this FOA. Studies on blood or tissue samples derived from human subjects, collected independently from the proposed project, will not be supported through this FOA.&nbsp;<strong>Investigators are encouraged to discuss their application with NIDDK staff prior to submitting an application</strong>.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p class=""regulartext"">Recent estimates of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the US population, obtained through analysis of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), indicate that it is a common medical problem, affecting over 26 million people in the US, and that its prevalence in the US has increased significantly over the last decade. Most cases of CKD observed in the US occur in the setting of diabetes, hypertension, glomerular disease and polycystic kidney disease.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">With the increase in CKD, the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has also been steadily increasing in the adult US population. The substantial morbidity and mortality experienced by ESRD patients and persons with earlier stages of CKD remains unabated. The increasing rate of ESRD has also markedly increased waiting time for cadaveric transplantation.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients is also a significant and increasing problem in the US. Medical management of acute kidney injury has traditionally consisted of supportive care, with renal replacement therapy implemented for the most severe cases. Despite such interventions in AKI, however, mortality rates in affected patients remain very high (&gt;50% in some series).</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">In view of these observations suggesting a high prevalence of CKD, and increasing ESRD and AKI in the US population, NIDDK has sponsored a number of large, multi-center studies of specific kidney disorders. These studies include prospective investigations in chronic kidney disease, dialysis access, polycystic kidney disease, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, and acute kidney injury. In planning and performing these studies, however, it has been apparent that the process for identifying appropriate interventions for both single and multi-center trials in kidney disease must be improved. This is particularly evident in the current small number of clinical studies related to kidney disease that could ultimately be expanded to large-scale clinical trials.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives</strong></div>    <p class=""regulartext"">The goal of this FOA is to provide flexibility for initiating preliminary, short-term studies, thus allowing new ideas to be investigated in a more expeditious manner without stringent requirements for preliminary data. Such support is needed to encourage new and experienced investigators to pursue new approaches, underdeveloped topics, or high risk research. If successful, these awards should lead to significant scientific advances in the treatment of kidney diseases.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">As the kidney diseases occur in a variety of clinical settings, and are associated with a number of co-morbid conditions, it is anticipated that applications submitted to this FOA could address a number of different aspects concerning the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of patients with kidney diseases.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Relevant topics of study evaluating kidney disease in adults or children could include (but are not limited to):</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Diagnosis, epidemiology, disease progression, prevention or therapy of patients with, or at risk for, the following conditions:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Chronic kidney disease, including studies of diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, polycystic kidney disease, or chronic renal allograft dysfunction</li>    <li>Glomerular disease, either idiopathic or secondary glomerular involvement in a systemic process</li>    <li>Acute kidney injury (excluding acute renal allograft rejection)</li>    <li>Co-morbid conditions associated with reduced kidney function</li>    <li>Studies assessing dialysis therapy, dialysis access, anemia of renal disease, nutritional or cardiovascular aspects of ESRD and other co-morbid conditions associated with ESRD</li>    <li>Validity of newly established or current diagnostic methods to predict response to treatment</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p class=""regulartext"">The evolution and vitality of the biomedical sciences require a constant infusion of new ideas, techniques, and points of view. These may differ substantially from current thinking or practice and may not yet be supported by substantial preliminary data. By using the R21 mechanism, the NIH seeks to foster the introduction of novel scientific ideas, tools, agents, targets, and technologies that have the potential to substantially advance biomedical research.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">The R21 mechanism is intended to encourage new exploratory and developmental research projects. For example, such projects could assess the feasibility of a novel area of investigation that has the potential to enhance health-related research. Another example could include the unique and innovative use of an existing methodology to explore a new scientific area. These studies may involve considerable risk but may lead to a breakthrough in a particular area, or to the development of novel techniques, agents, methodologies, or applications that could have a major impact on a field of clinical research.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Applications for R21 awards should describe projects distinct from those supported through the traditional R01 mechanism. For example, long-term projects, or projects designed to increase knowledge in a well-established area, will not be considered for R21 awards.

The quality of mitochondria present at different stages of oocyte development from the primordial germ cell stage to the fertilizable state in the mature follicle, and in the preimplantation embryo have never been clearly defined. Thus, this FOA calls for novel approaches for assessment of mitochondrial health in the oocyte and preimplantation embryo. While minimal or no preliminary data are expected to be described, applications should clearly indicate the significance of the proposed research and/or that the approach is scientifically sound, that the qualifications of the investigators are appropriate, and that the resources available to the investigators are adequate.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p>Mitochondria are cytoplasmic organelles separated from the cytoplasm by a double membrane. Mitochondria possess their own genome with 37 genes coding for 13 respiratory chain proteins, 2 rRNAs, and 22tRNAs. The 13 respiratory chain proteins along with many other respiratory chain proteins coded by nuclear DNA are responsible for energy generation by oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial function is under the control of two genomes that are inherited independently. Unlike nuclear genes, mutations in mitochondrial DNA are inherited through the maternal line and the number of mitochondria and those harboring disease causing mutations, termed heteroplasmy, can vary from cell to cell.</p>    <p>Oocytes develop from primordial germ cells in the embryo. Primordial germ cells possess approximately 100-200 mitochondria per cell, and each cell will have only one or two copies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). During oogenesis, there is increase in both the number of mitochondria and the mtDNA copy number. A mature, fertilizable metaphase II oocyte will have approximately 100,000 mitochondria, and correspondingly will have &gt;200,000 copies of mtDNA. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), unlike the nuclear genome, is transmitted to the offspring from the population of mitochondria present in the oocytes at the time of fertilization.</p>    <p>Bioenergy generated by mitochondria is critical for normal and successful maturation of oocytes in preparation for fertilization. A reduced mitochondrial number and activity could lead to disrupted meiotic spindle, aneuploidy, poor embryonic development, implantation failure, miscarriage, and birth defects. This may underlie the cause for decline in natural fertility (in infertile or subfertile young women, and women with diminished ovarian reserve) and poor in vitro fertilization (IVF) success rates, especially in women of advanced maternal age.</p>    <p>After fertilization and during preimplantation development of the embryo, mitochondria derived from the oocyte are the major source of energy. Good quality embryos are produced with good quality oocytes with optimal number of mitochondria. Pre-implantation development of the embryo is solely dependent upon the competence and quality of the mitochondria supplied by the maternal oocyte, since the amplification of mitochondria do not occur until the late stages of preimplantation development.</p>    <p>Mutations in mtDNA are surprisingly very high. Point mutations and deletions/duplications in mtDNA have been associated with many human diseases, such as myopathies, neurodegenerative disorders, birth defects, diabetes, cancer, and infertility. Mitochondria with mutations in their genome may also be passed on to the offspring. The severity of these diseases depends upon the specific mutation and its penetrance, and the percentage of mtDNA with the mutation (heteroplasmy level). Thus, the percent of mutant copy numbers in a fertilizable oocyte determines the expression or severity of the disease.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives</strong></div>    <p>A major goal of this FOA is to stimulate research that will broaden our understanding of how stage-specific formation and function of mitochondria impact upon the oocyte quality and fertility in women, and on mitochondrial disease transmission to the offspring.</p>    <p>Possible research topics that may be addressed in response to this FOA include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Mitochondrial function in all aspects of mammalian reproduction including oocyte development and maturation, fertilization, and embryonic development</li>    <li>Role of mitochondria in stem cell maintenance and lineage specification in the embryo</li>    <li>Assisted reproductive technologies and their impact on mitochondrial function in oocytes and embryos</li>    <li>Mitochondrial function in oocytes and embryos during maternal aging</li>    <li>Studies on the link between diminished ovarian follicle reserve and mitochondrial function</li>    <li>Metabolic disorders and their impact on mitochondrial function in oocytes and embryos</li>    <li>Fundamental studies on mitochondrial mutations and their transmission to the offspring, and characterization of mitochondrial diseases</li>    <li>Studies on the interaction of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes and its impact on oocyte and fertility, development and disease processes</li>    <li>Approaches to enhance mitochondrial function in the oocyte through therapeutic agents</li>    <li>Preclinical studies in animal model systems for development of novel procedures for mitochondrial replacement in the oocytes</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>The R21 activity code is intended to encourage new exploratory and developmental research projects. For example, such projects could assess the feasibility of a novel area of investigation or a new experimental system that has the potential to enhance health-related research. Another example could include the unique and innovative use of an existing methodology to explore a new scientific</p>    <p>area. These studies may involve considerable risk but may lead to a breakthrough in a particular area, or to the development of novel techniques, agents, methodologies, models, or applications that could have a major impact on a field of biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research.</p>    <p>Applications for R21 awards should describe projects distinct from those supported through the traditional R01 activity code. For example, long-term projects, or projects designed to increase knowledge in a well-established area, will not be considered for R21 awards. Applications submitted to this FOA should be exploratory and novel.

Based on a competitive peer review process, 13 grants were awarded by OBSSR.&nbsp; The scientific contribution of this programmatic effort produced an impressive bibliography of several dozen original peer reviewed publications.&nbsp; Both a brief history and listing of the resulting publications of the 2003 FOA can be read here:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""https://obssr.od.nih.gov/scientific-initiatives/health-and-education/"">https://obssr.od.nih.gov/scientific-initiatives/health-and-education/</a></p>    <p>From an NIH perspective, the findings built on previous research by formalizing how education is clearly linked to a variety of specific and important health behaviors and conditions, therefore bringing the science closer to a mechanistic understanding of the causal pathways. For instance, some researchers found a moderate to strong association between educational attainment and several different biological risk factors, such as markers of inflammation, higher/lower cardiovascular risks, and hypercholesterolemia. Other researchers focused on a wide variety of specific illnesses and health problems, including diabetes, depression, and mental well-being. Still others examined how education is linked to positive and negative health behaviors, such as smoking cigarettes, drug and alcohol abuse, and utilization of medical screening programs.&nbsp;</p>    <p>As is often the case in science, these advances in our understanding also raised new questions.</p>    <p>For instance, many of these studies didn't specifically study the education process, per se, making it difficult to parse out the contributions of education from overall socioeconomic status (SES). Additionally, due to data limitations, many of the studies utilized very limited measurements of education, such as high school completion verses not completed, or cognitive performance and IQ as surrogates for education. Although this is not an unreasonable empirical strategy when faced with data limitations, these approaches limit our ability to determine which specific features of the educational experience are linked to improved health. For example, what types of skills and knowledge are relevant to specific positive health outcomes, and how does schooling lead to the acquisition of these skills and knowledge?</p>    <p>Related, are there critical periods in the life course during which education has a greater impact on the trajectory of an individual&rsquo;s health than at other times&mdash;for example, during pre-school, adolescence, or college? Are health benefits associated with adult education and occupational training or continuing education later in life? Are the health benefits of additional years of schooling constant no matter what the baseline level of education? Does it matter what kind of education you get: private, public, home-school, or for higher level education; technical/vocational or liberal arts; online or in a traditional setting?&nbsp; Does the quality of education matter, and if so, which aspects of quality? How do you measure 'quality'? How does the role of the teacher versus the family affect the linkage to positive or negative health outcomes?</p>    <p>The goals of this FOA are to further elucidate the pathways involved in the relationship between education and health outcomes and in doing so to carefully identify the specific aspects and qualities of education that are responsible for this relationship and what the mediating factors are that affect the nature of the causal relationship.</p>    <p><strong>Nature of Research Problem</strong></p>    <p>In June 2014, OBSSR convened a workshop that brought together clinicians and researchers in education and health in order to identify opportunities and gaps in the field as well as to develop strategies to ensure that education and health research remains a national priority. A summary of the meeting can be read here:&nbsp;<a href=""https://obssr.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/OBSSR_Education_and_Health_REV_8-22-2014_FINAL_RLA.pdf"">https://obssr.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/OBSSR_Education_and_Health_REV_8-22-2014_FINAL_RLA.pdf</a></p>    <p>Areas of research that were emphasized included: developing better measures of health outcomes (including cognitive function, subjective well-being, etc.), improving study designs, identifying mechanisms underlying the relationship between education and health, and considering contextual issues. Additionally, it was noted that there must also be attention to longitudinal research to understand long-term implications of early interventions and replication of studies to verify results. Themes evident throughout the meeting included the nature of the causal relationship between education and health, contextual issues, the need for more and better data, and interventions in education and health.&nbsp;</p>    <p>A number of private foundations have current initiatives which examine the links between health and education. The William T. Grant Foundation has recently examined the infrastructure to improve the use and usefulness of research in education (<a title=""Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"" href=""http://blog.wtgrantfoundation.org/"">http://blog.wtgrantfoundation.org/</a>). The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is exploring education and health within its series on the social determinants of health (<a href=""http://www.rwjf.org/en/how-we-work/grants/programs-and-initiatives.html"">http://www.rwjf.org/en/how-we-work/grants/programs-and-initiatives.html</a>). Their work examines the interrelated pathways through which educational attainment is linked to health outcomes, including through employment and income, and social and psychological factors. The W. K. Kellogg Foundation is addressing the health and well-being of children and families from interrelated fronts, including nutrition and education (<a href=""http://www.wkkf.org/grantseekers"">http://www.wkkf.org/grantseekers</a>). The Open Society Foundation is committed to supporting quality education across the globe, imagining education as a key to civic participation and healthy lives (<a href=""http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/"">http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/</a>). This FOA seeks to supplement the work of these foundations by promoting an examination of the specific mechanisms through which educational experiences and activities are linked to health outcomes, elucidate pathways and inform causal models that can inform more targeted interventions.</p>    <p>Recent contemporary work on educational attainment and adult health has demonstrated that the treatment of health is multi-dimensional and the treatment of education is not limited to a simple operationalization. Both health and education need to be examined in complex ways, using novel methodological tools and datasets, as well as situating analyses across diverse global spaces and within specific historical time periods to better understand the macro mechanisms which link educational attainment with health outcomes.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Research Objectives</strong></p>    <p>For this FOA, education refers to the comprehensive formal instruction that spans the human experience, from early childhood programs to pre-school, elementary and secondary schooling, college and adult learning programs. It includes the social and behavioral processes that are combined with formal instruction in educational environments. A better scientific understanding of the mechanisms linking education and health could lead to additional and improved prevention and therapeutic intervention strategies for important health problems. NOTE: This FOA is not directed at studies which limit their focus to the impact of specific health education courses or programs on health behaviors; rather, the focus is on the impact of more general education experiences.&nbsp;</p>    <p>In order to better understand these pathways, it will be necessary to explore which components or dimensions of education are important to health. The association or pathway between formal education and important health behaviors or diseases may not be causal. Instead it may reflect the influence of confounding or co-existing determinants or bi-directionality. Appropriate research topics for this FOA may involve pilot studies, new analyses of existing data, longitudinal studies, or a balance of approaches tailored for the study hypotheses. It is strongly encouraged that an application involve new teams of multidisciplinary researchers with expertise in both health and education domains.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Applications for R21 awards should describe projects distinct from those supported through the traditional R01 activity code. For example, long-term projects, or projects designed to increase knowledge in a well-established area, are not appropriate for R21 awards. Applications submitted to this FOA should be exploratory and novel. These studies should break new ground or extend previous discoveries toward new directions or applications.</p>    <p><strong>Research Perspectives and Themes</strong></p>    <p>To achieve the goal of a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms linking education and health outcomes, this FOA encourages the exploration of research perspectives and themes described below. The NIH believes these approaches may move current research efforts to the next level of accomplishment. Applicants are not required to incorporate all of the themes below into their research applications; however, applicants should explicitly address at least one.</p>    <p>Education and Health Across the Age Spectrum</p>    <p>Formal education often occurs at the stage of the life cycle when significant formation of health behaviors is also occurring; these specific formal educational experiences as well as the social context provided by the school and the behavior and norms of the other students may either directly or indirectly influence the development of health behaviors. Education may improve health by laying the foundation for the individual's integration in to society, not only in terms of the content of the curriculum, but also in terms of social competencies and the ability to function in hierarchical, structured settings (i.e., universities and colleges, employment settings, civic society, etc.). Because of the critical need for additional information on the pathways that link education with a variety of diseases and health risk factors, researchers are encouraged, but not required, to include in any research project objectives directed at both (1) better understanding the relationship between education and a specific disease or important macro- and/or micro- health risk factor and (2) better understanding the relationship between one or more pathways that explain the association between education and general health and wellbeing. Examples of possible relevant topics might include the following (but are in no way limited to this suggested list):</p>    <p>-&nbsp; Through which biological pathways (including neurological, inflammatory, and endocrinological&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; networks) does education affect health?</p>    <p>-&nbsp; What is the effect(s) of education on the function or structure of the brain (eg. prefrontal cortex,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; temporal lobe, etc.), during the period of formal education; is there the evidence of the persistence of these alterations into adulthood?</p>    <p>-&nbsp; What mechanisms account for the impact of education on the risk of neurological diseases later in life such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, or cancer-related cognitive impairment?</p>    <p>-&nbsp; How does sleep moderate or mediate the relationship between education and health?</p>    <p>-&nbsp; How might education buffer against the acute and chronic effects of physiological and psychological stress in adulthood? Does education have its effect by an enhancement of coping resources or strategies?&nbsp;</p>    <p>-&nbsp; What impacts do the demands of various educational programs (at all levels) have on students&rsquo; stress levels and subsequent health outcomes, both in the short and long term? Do stress management programs moderate these effects?</p>    <p>-&nbsp; How does education affect mental health outcomes, including depression and other mental disorders?</p>    <p>-&nbsp; What is the effect of education and moderating factors such as peer/group effects and/or social context formation provided by the school on the development of health behaviors?</p>    <p>-&nbsp; The effect of education and educational outcomes on the initiation, maintenance, and/or cessation of risky behaviors such as substance abuse. Compare/contrast trajectories of risky behavior with initiation, maintenance, and/or cessation of healthy behaviors. Also, how do these risky/healthy behaviors support or interfere with the pursuit of education?</p>    <p>-&nbsp; How do specific formal education experiences (e.g. public, private, charter, homeschooling, online, etc.) influence health outcomes and behaviors?</p>    <p>-&nbsp; Do changes in educational policies and requirements at the local, state, tribal, and national level result in changes in educational outcomes, attitudes towards education, and health outcomes?</p>    <p>-&nbsp; How does the timing of education, (e.g. Education obtained in adulthood versus the more traditional educational trajectory of grade school and high school) affect health outcomes?</p>    <p>-&nbsp; How do parental inputs, including parental educational status and attitudes towards education, influence educational outcomes? How do the influences of educational trajectories and health outcomes of siblings and other household members alter this relationship?</p>    <p>-&nbsp; Research on the sensitive periods in prenatal, early and middle childhood development (e.g. small class sizes in kindergarten through 3rd grade, early childhood interventions) and their impact on education and health outcomes.</p>    <p>-&nbsp; How does the changing distribution of mental health diagnoses (e.g., how conditions are defined such as of LD, ADHD, etc.) and how this changes the perception of the link between education and health? Is this different over time and what are the mechanisms?</p>    <p>-&nbsp; Are the behavioral, psychological, and neurobiological risk factors associated with poor early educational experiences plastic or malleable in mid-life? Can we identify targets for intervention in mid-late life that might compensate for or remediate deficits associated with these risk factors?</p>    <p>-&nbsp; Research on the mechanisms that account for links between personality and other non-cognitive skills and capacities to educational attainment, and the associated pathways linking these individual difference factors to health outcomes in later life.</p>    <p>-&nbsp; How malleable are personality and non-cognitive skills and capacities throughout the lifespan? Do these factors have an impact on the effectiveness of educational programs at any life stage?</p>    <p>-&nbsp; Research on the supported education for individuals with mental illness or with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in all levels of formal education including post-secondary and its effects on health and quality of life measures, including longer term functioning and employment outcomes.</p>    <p>Innovative Data and Methodologies<br />Particular school-based studies have included the collection of health data, and allow for potentially important research on the links between education and health. For instance, both the &ldquo;Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort&rdquo; (ECLS-B; birth through kindergarten) and the &ldquo;Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten&rdquo; (ECLS-K; kindergarten through eighth grade) include data on children&rsquo;s cognitive, physical, social, and emotional development in the home, childcare, and school settings. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) &ldquo;High School and Beyond&rdquo; includes data on general health, access to health care, and health insurance status. It is the intention of this FOA to inspire collaborative work across disciplines, and through innovative methodologies to explore the mechanisms linking health outcomes to educational experiences.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Examples of possible relevant topics may include the following (but are in no way limited to this list):</p>    <p>-&nbsp; How can we more accurately or completely characterize or measure education (including teacher-student interaction in a more formal education setting, but also non-formal social forms of education, e.g., tribal, church, scouts, musical instruction, school clubs etc.), beyond simply as years of education without regard to the characteristics or nature of the educational experience?&nbsp;</p>    <p>-&nbsp; How do we measure &ldquo;quality&rdquo; of education, such as the relationship between teacher instructional styles and quality of teaching and health outcomes?</p>    <p>-&nbsp; Equivalently, are there innovations in metrics of resilience/personality, either on the individual or structural supports (e.g., family, church, other) that may confer some protection from risk and may help predict why someone in a poor quality education institution can do well later in life?&nbsp;</p>    <p>-&nbsp; In what ways do education quality, content, and/or appropriateness of the curriculum moderate the association between educational attainment and health?</p>    <p>-&nbsp; Cross-national comparisons of education&rsquo;s effects on health behaviors</p>; <div class=""heading2""><strong>Award Information</strong></div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Funding Instrument</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>Grant: A support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Application Types Allowed</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>New&nbsp;<br />Resubmission&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11116"">OER Glossary</a>&nbsp;and the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide provide details on these application types.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Clinical Trial?</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>Optional: Accepting applications that either propose or do not propose clinical trial(s)</p>    <p><a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=82370"">Need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?</a></p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Funds Available and Anticipated Number of Awards</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>The number of awards is contingent upon NIH appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Award Budget</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>The combined budget for direct costs for the two year project period may not exceed $275,000.

The FOA will support efforts to optimize and evaluate measures of neurophysiological processes that are disrupted within or across mental disorders in both healthy humans and in another species relevant to the therapeutic development pipeline. &nbsp;The initiative will support initial proof of concept studies aimed at identifying measures for potential development as preclinical assays for evaluating potential new drug and device therapies and their targets. Data will also reveal assay measures where the performance between preclinical animal species and humans is dissimilar, thus establishing a firm basis for limiting speculative extrapolations of preclinical animal findings to humans. The ultimate practical goal of this FOA is to improve the efficiency of the therapeutic development process by identifying coherence of measures and inconsistencies between the preclinical screening pipeline and clinical evaluation of new treatment candidates and thereby hasten the development of more effective treatments for mental disorders.</p>    <p>The objectives of the FOA will be accomplished by supporting partnerships among basic and translational neuroscientists who are committed to advancing the discovery of in vivo physiological measures as tools for target validation and therapeutic development. Groups will be tasked with developing and optimizing in vivo assays of brain processes in both animals and in healthy humans. Groups will evaluate assay performance across both species in response to specific chemical, physiological, or behavioral manipulations. In this way, projects will reveal the potential of specific assays to translate from animals to humans, suggesting assays for further development as tools in the treatment development pipeline. &nbsp;</p>    <p class=""heading4""><strong>Background</strong></p>    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/index.shtml"">NIMH Strategic Plan for Research</a>&nbsp;outlines research priorities for transforming the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses. The plan includes two cross-cutting themes which are directly relevant to the goals of this FOA, Transforming Diagnostics and Accelerating Therapeutics. A core component of the Transforming Diagnostics theme is the Research Domains Criteria&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/rdoc/index.shtml"">(RDoC)</a>&nbsp;project.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/rdoc/index.shtml"">RDoC</a>&nbsp;has grown into a significant effort for the NIMH that frees investigators from the current symptom-based diagnostic categories (i.e., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, DSM) and encourages clinical researchers to study dimensions of observable behavior and neurobiological measures that may span multiple disorders. Similarly, basic neuroscientists are encouraged to address molecular and neural mechanisms underlying specific domains of mental function, rather than creating animal models of diseases. Relevant to the Accelerating Therapeutics theme, NIMH has shifted its&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas/index.shtml"">clinical trials</a>&nbsp;portfolio toward studies with defined targets and milestones. In contrast to previous studies that looked only for statistical differences in efficacy, the Institute&rsquo;s new experimental medicine approach seeks trials that will address the mechanisms of disorders, providing a foundation for building specific treatment strategies.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Implementation of experimental medicine designs in early phase trials of novel treatments for mental disorders requires a demonstration that the proposed intervention engages the target sufficiently to evaluate target-mediated effects on brain processes and clinical outcomes. In this context, &lsquo;target&rsquo; refers to the brain signaling system, circuit, or physiological process the therapeutic strategy aims to correct as a means of improving function across mental disorders. The RDoC effort has the potential to identify measures that can be incorporated in experimental medicine trial designs to evaluate links between targets, circuits and key functional domains in relation to clinical improvements. However, the potential success of the emerging clinical efforts is diluted by the lack of reciprocal efforts to develop assays of neural processes in the preclinical species component of a therapeutic development testing funnel. This lack of continuity of functional measures of target engagement between the preclinical species selected for use in treatment development and evaluation of effects in humans contributes uncertainty to an already risky pipeline of treatment development for mental disorders. For example, it is not surprising that commonly used preclinical behavioral assays whose original value was based on their ability to detect certain classes of compounds (e.g., the Porsolt swim test to identify serotonin uptake inhibitors as antidepressants), are poor predictors of the potential clinical efficacy of compounds that engage novel molecular targets.</p>    <p class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives</strong></p>    <p>The purpose of this FOA is to address the translational divide between preclinical and clinical measures implemented in the treatment development pipeline for mental disorders by supporting the construction of a suite of in vivo functional brain assays and the evaluation of the measures for translational predictive value. Towards this goal, the FOA will support the identification, development, optimization and evaluation of in vivo CNS assays that measure particular brain functions that are evolutionarily conserved between the selected animal species and humans. The FOA will additionally support assessment of the performance (sensitivity) of brain based assays in both the preclinical species and in healthy humans in response to carefully selected pharmacological, physiological, or behavioral manipulations. Assays will aim to identify quantitative, robust and reliable measures that tap into specific neurophysiological systems that are potentially impacted in mental disorders such as neural plasticity, cognitive or affective regulatory processes, or impulsivity. The manipulations will provide a critical first evaluation of how the measure performs in the context of the therapeutic development pipeline spanning from the preclinical species to humans.</p>    <p>Proposed assay measures are expected to have reasonable likelihood of shared conservation of physiology and brain circuitry across healthy human controls and a preclinical species. While there is a risk that measures of some brain processes may be difficult to optimize for cross-species evaluation or may not show coherence between species, this risk is managed by the UG3/UH3 mechanism, a two stage phased innovation cooperative agreement award. The UG3 phase supports the planning and preliminary studies needed to conduct an evaluation of the performance of assays in both species in the UH3 phase. Projects will be milestone driven with an administrative review by internal NIMH staff to identify UG3 projects attaining milestones and demonstrating feasibility of assays in both species for advancement to the assay testing (UH3) phase. The cooperative agreement component allows for greater involvement of NIMH staff in the conduct of the projects, including suggesting external advisors, and providing opportunities for multiple FOA awardee groups to interact and share data. Should multiple UG3/UH3 awards be issued, it is expected that the groups will meet annually as a consortium to share updates on progress, to troubleshoot, and to outline strategies for disseminating data.</p>    <p>While it is understood that many protocols and the data generated will be at an early proof-of-concept stage, a central goal of this FOA is to contribute to building a more robust, experimentally based therapeutic development pipeline for mental disorders. Regardless of study outcomes, it is expected that experimental protocols and data generated through both the UG3 and UH3 phases of this FOA will be made available to the research community as a valuable source of information regarding relationships between animal assay results and human data no later than within one year of completion of the studies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p>The initiative will support partnerships among basic and translational neuroscientists who are committed to the discovery of translational physiological measures that may be used across preclinical development and that have the highest potential to be advanced into healthy human trials as tools for therapeutic development.</p>    <p>Potential applicants are strongly encouraged to read the Frequently Asked Questions (<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/grant-writing-and-application-process/faqs-for-rfa-mh-16-220.shtml"">FAQs</a>) for this FOA and to contact NIMH&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-18-268.html#_Scientific/Research_Contact(s)"">Scientific/Research Contact(s)</a>&nbsp;prior to preparing an application.</p>    <p class=""heading4"">Research Scope</p>    <p>This FOA will support the phased development of in vivo assays to address translational gaps in treatment development for mental disorders. Support will be provided for assay development efforts that propose quantitative measures to assess alterations in neurophysiology/circuit activity that contribute to or reflect clinically relevant domains of function (e.g., cognitive function, impulsivity, and motivation, etc.).</p>    <p>Proposed projects may include:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Development and testing of in vivo neurophysiological measures that tap into fundamental processes that are disrupted within or across mental disorders such as aspects of vigilance, neural plasticity, reward processing, or attentional mechanisms contributing to cognition and/or affect regulation, that can be objectively measured in both live animals and humans using brain imaging or neurophysiological measures such as spectral EEG or MEG to assess brain rhythms with different frequencies. Innovative measures are encouraged.</li>    <li>Development and testing of highly tractable behavioral paradigms as assays that may serve as proxies of neural circuit activity linked to a specific functional domain in both humans and animals. For example, the CNTRICS program identified constructs across six cognitive systems relevant to schizophrenia and selected tasks from cognitive neuroscience that measure the constructs&nbsp;<a title=""Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"" href=""http://cntrics.ucdavis.edu/index.shtml"">http://cntrics.ucdavis.edu/index.shtml</a>. Such studies should combine behavioral and physiological measures (for example, tracking changes in forebrain oscillations during performance). Since the goal is to build innovation and address translational gaps, the inclusion of behavioral paradigms that are already commonly used cross species (e.g., fear conditioning) must incorporate novel measures of underlying neuronal processes.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><strong>Projects Out of Scope for this Announcement Include:</strong></p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Development or inclusion of animal models ""of"" mental disorders.

Each phase is milestone driven and only those projects attaining the UG3 milestones have potential to progress to the UH3 phase. The UG3 phase supports feasibility testing and optimization of measures in animals and humans. The UH3 phase supports parallel testing of the measures in both animals and humans in response to variations of a manipulation as a way to evaluate the performance, sensitivity, and coherence of measures across species.</p>    <p>1. The UG3 Preparatory Testing and Prioritization Phase (Stage 1) for this FOA supports milestone-driven optimization of testing and prioritization of measures that tap into mental health relevant brain processes (e.g., neural plasticity, cognitive or affect regulatory processes, impulsivity) and neural circuit activity as assays in both animals and humans. For example, some assay measures that are already developed in the animal species selected will need to be adapted for humans while other assays may need to be back-translated from humans to the preclinical species. Other measures in this phase may need to be optimized in both species. Studies are expected to be performed in live animals and humans and not in cell culture, post mortem, or in vitro preparations. The only exception would be the allowance of a small number of limited studies in the UG3 phase aimed at identifying levels (e.g., doses) of the manipulations to be used in the UH3 phase for equivalent target engagement across species.&nbsp;</p>    <p>UG3 projects are milestone driven and include go-no-go criteria for each assay that will be used to determine whether assays are sufficiently optimized and methodologically equated across species. UG3 assays that meet the scientific milestones and feasibility requirements may be eligible for transition to the second UH3 stage pending NIH administrative review, availability of funds, and programmatic balance.</p>    <p>2. The UH3 Measure Evaluation Phase (Stage 2) will support milestone-driven evaluation of measures optimized in the UG3 phase by examining the effects of manipulations in both humans and the preclinical species in parallel. By employing the same manipulation at more than one level (dose, intensity, duration, etc.), where levels are chosen for comparable potency across species, data collected in this phase will assess the degree of cross species coherence of performance of the measures as assays. Examples of the types of manipulations appropriate for this phase include, but are not limited to:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>An FDA approved medication that targets a circuit critical to the measure</li>    <li>A chemical challenge such as lactate or CO2 to engage hypervigilance</li>    <li>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to modify cortical circuits underlying specific learning processes</li>    <li>Alterations in reward contingencies to modify striatal circuits</li>    <li>A noise distractor manipulation to assess the impact of different brain rhythms on plasticity</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>The purpose of the manipulations is solely to evaluate the performance of the assays, not to address mechanistic hypotheses or test novel therapeutic targets.</p>    <p>Expected outcomes include the identification of promising measures for further development as tools for assessing biological effects of novel therapeutic candidates across preclinical and healthy human studies. Data will also identify measures that differ in performance between preclinical species and humans, thus establishing a firm basis for limiting speculations about the potential clinical significance of preclinical assay data. Although only preclinical and healthy human studies would be supported by this FOA, the emphasis is on developing measures that will ultimately be useful for the evaluation of novel therapeutic mechanisms in patients with mental disorders.</p>    <p>The overall goal is to transform experimental protocols in both animals and humans into assays for use in the therapeutic development pipeline. Ideally, the most promising in vivo assays have potential to be standardized and adapted for broader use across laboratories. This effort will build towards a critical understanding of the predictive value of assays as applied across preclinical species and humans. The effort will also begin to build critical measures of analytical performance (sensitivity, specificity, precision, stability, and reproducibility) that may be used to set standards for replication and verification of assay findings and to advance promising biomarkers and targets to clinical applications in subsequent projects.</p>    <p>Rigor of Data: Translating discoveries into evidence-based treatments is predicated on the existence of strong, well powered, adequately controlled, and replicated preclinical and clinical data. In addition, the value of such research is greatly enhanced when detailed information is made available about study design, execution, analysis and interpretation. Examples of critical elements are outlined in the section IV.2 and detailed in&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-103.html"">NOT-OD-15-103</a>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/policies/enhancing-the-reliability-of-nimh-supported-research-through-rigorous-study-design-and-reporting.shtml"">NIMH guidelines</a>. As per&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-102.html"">NOT-OD-15-102</a>, it is expected that animal and human studies will include both males and females.</p>    <p><strong>Milestones</strong></p>    <p>Because novel translational assay development and evaluation in the UG3 phase are likely to be high risk, it is anticipated that there will be attrition of some projects after the assay optimization phase (UG3).

Approximately one-quarter of suicide decedents had treatment for psychiatric issues prior to their death.&nbsp; The Zero Suicide approach was developed specifically to target health and behavioral healthcare systems and to provide them with a specific set of health care strategies and tools for the reduction of suicide events within facilities, as well as for individuals in the community who are linked to the care system.</p>    <p><strong>Burden of Suicidal Behavior in Health Systems</strong>. Since 1995 the Joint Commission has consistently listed suicide among the top 5&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.jointcommission.org/sentinel_event_statistics_quarterly/"">sentinel events</a>, i.e., unexpected occurrences involving death or serious physical or psychological injury, in health care settings. Of the 1.3 million individuals in the US who reported making a suicide attempt within the past 12 months, about 6% also reported receiving treatment in an outpatient mental health clinic (estimated 206,000 cases). Rates of individuals reporting attempts within the year have also been estimated for those receiving care in other settings that include: those receiving substance use treatment (5%, estimated 122,000 cases); and those having accessed emergency care in the same year (1%, estimated 728,000 cases). Despite the large number of suicide events among persons receiving healthcare, only 28 states require health care systems to report adverse events that include suicide deaths and attempts, that occur during or following receipt of services. Lack of information about the rate and nature of suicide events within and between care systems hinders efforts to eliminate these adverse events through quality improvement initiatives.</p>    <p><strong>A Learning Healthcare System to Reduce Suicidal Behavior</strong>. A learning healthcare system links suicidal behavior outcomes to care processes and service use patterns, considers what care improvements can be tested to reduce suicidal behaviors, and measures the impact of care improvements. Several systems-level improvements have been associated with lower suicide risk in health care organizations like the Henry Ford Health System, the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.va.gov/health/aboutvha.asp"">Veterans Health Administration</a>, and mental health services in England and Wales. These system level improvements include (1) providing 24-hour crisis teams; (2) managing patients with co-occurring disorders (e.g., mental and substance use disorders); (3) conducting multidisciplinary reviews of suicide deaths; (4) sharing information with families after a suicide and making future care improvements as a result; (5) removing ligature points from inpatient settings; (6) conducting follow-up with patients within a week of discharge; (7) conducting assertive community outreach; (8) providing regular training to frontline clinicians on the management of suicide risk; (9) responding to patients who do not comply with treatment; (10) sharing information with criminal justice agencies; and (11) reducing access to lethal means, such as firearms. The largest systems-level study found that suicide deaths decreased most in care settings that implemented the greatest number of improvements. The incorporation of more technologies into these service streams could accelerate the implementation and adoption of these approaches into more service settings, and enhance the existing ones.</p>    <p>In the US, a number of subgroups within health care systems have been found to have higher risk. Target subgroups have been defined by service characteristics (e.g., patients who are new to a system; individuals transitioning from one care setting to another; patients who drop out of treatment), as well as by individual patient characteristics (e.g., particular age and gender groups; those with psychotic disorders; substance abuse; chronic pain) or health history (e.g., having made multiple suicide attempts).&nbsp; The development and evaluation of novel technological approaches is in line with the objectives of the Zero Suicide initiative and these approaches will likely be essential components of strategies to identify and provide treatment to individuals within health and behavioral health systems who are at high risk.</p>    <p>Applications submitted to this FOA should propose a research strategy focused on the development and testing of technologies that are intended to reduce suicide events (attempts; deaths) and frequent precursors (e.g., suicide ideation) among individuals in health care systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This FOA encourages SBIR applicants to establish multidisciplinary collaborations with organizations that have infrastructure already in place regarding suicide prevention at the state, federal and local level.&nbsp; Examples of collaborations include:&nbsp; 1) state collaborations in order to utilize morbidity and mortality surveillance systems (many supported by CDC,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/"">http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/nvdrs.html"">http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/nvdrs.html</a>); 2) collaborations with states that are implementing laws regarding provider training in suicide mitigation and may need technologies to assist with training, monitoring provider skills, and monitoring outcomes; 3) leveraging federal investments that support behavioral health needs (SAMHSA funded services within states:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.samhsa.gov/grants-awards-by-state"">http://www.samhsa.gov/grants-awards-by-state</a>), and primary care (HRSA funded services within states:&nbsp;<a href=""http://datawarehouse.hrsa.gov/Topics/HrsaInYour.aspx"">http://datawarehouse.hrsa.gov/Topics/HrsaInYour.aspx</a>) are also important opportunities, as a number of these investments include suicide prevention as bench mark outcomes; 4) collaborations with healthcare centers engaged in the Zero Suicide effort who can provide the necessary healthcare settings and expertise to test feasibility and implementation of the technology developed under this effort.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Small business applicants are also encouraged to review the&nbsp;<a href=""http://actionallianceforsuicideprevention.org/sites/actionallianceforsuicideprevention.org/files/Agenda.pdf"">Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention</a>&nbsp;regarding the state of the science and potential gaps that technologies could fill.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Topics</strong></div>    <p>This FOA supports the development, testing and validation of novel technologies with commercial potential that enable or enhance healthcare organizations' abilities to advance the Zero Suicide agenda.&nbsp;

To achieve these ends, this FOA encourages a multi-discipline approach to foster collaborations between geriatricians (particularly those with knowledge of cognitive impairment and dementia), psychologists, neurologists, computer scientists, and mechanical, electrical, and software engineering professionals.</p>    <p>NIA anticipates that the development of next-generation SARs would enable AD and ADRD patients and their caregivers to preserve and, to the extent possible, enhance their psychosocial and cognitive coping skills and resources.&nbsp; To these ends, NIA seeks research and development of SARs that would provide capabilities and resources to compensate for AD and ADRD-related challenges and deficits, including the capabilities to interpret and translate cognitive intent (to perform certain activities), make context-based decisions, and help AD/ADRD patients perform activities of daily living.&nbsp;

Individuals must navigate the continuum of PrEP care for effective HIV prevention benefit. These steps include being aware of PrEP, being screened as a PrEP candidate, linkage to PrEP programs and providers, receipt of a PrEP prescription, PrEP adherence and persistence, and sustained retention in comprehensive PrEP care, which includes regular HIV testing and clinical care visits.</p>    <p>It is widely understood that gaps in the HIV treatment continuum limit the number of people living with HIV infection who achieve viral suppression. Similarly, failure to complete all facets of the PrEP care continuum will limit the number of people who receive preventive benefits from PrEP.</p>    <p>There are important behavioral, social, and healthcare delivery challenges that merit urgent attention, across the PrEP care continuum. PrEP awareness and availability remain variable across key populations and settings. Individuals for whom PrEP is indicated may not perceive themselves to be at risk for HIV infection. Racial/ethnic and age disparities in PrEP uptake and use have been evidenced. PrEP use can be constrained by healthcare coverage gaps and financial constraints that prohibit clinic visits, including prescription copayment costs. Healthcare providers and organizations may lack training, tools, procedures, or specialists to facilitate PrEP delivery. Psychosocial concerns which include active mental and substance use disorders could influence adherence to PrEP medication regimens and retention in care for clinical monitoring and regular HIV testing.

Mental disorders have been associated with increased HIV acquisition and transmission risk behaviors, and documented as a barrier to the uptake of HIV prevention tools such as HIV testing and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), as well as HIV care and treatment. Depression is the most common mental disorder associated with risk for HIV infection or transmission. Other common disorders include mood (e.g., bipolar), anxiety (e.g., generalized or posttraumatic stress), substance use (e.g., drug abuse) and psychotic (e.g., schizophrenia). Depression is also a common barrier to early linkage and HIV care retention, Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) adherence, viral suppression and long-term clinical outcomes. Moreover, socioecological factors such as stigma, violence, unstable housing, and poverty produce additive or multiplicative effects on the association between mental health and HIV. As a result, the relationship among mental disorders, other comorbidities, and co-occurring socioecological factors in HIV prevention and treatment is complex. There are multi-level and bi-directional influences among bio-behavioral and psychosocial pathways that mediate and moderate mental health and HIV outcomes.</p>    <p>To date, research on mechanisms through which mental health affects HIV prevention and care outcomes is limited by cross-sectional designs and incomplete datasets. Multi-level barriers (e.g., patient, provider, setting or system) hamper effective identification and treatment delivery; thus, mental disorders remain largely unaddressed and untreated, even for those in regular primary and HIV care. The evidence for delivering efficacious mental health interventions (e.g., antidepressant therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) to improve HIV outcomes among PLHIV is mixed. Effective mental health treatment may need to be combined with effective HIV prevention and care to maximally improve mental health and HIV outcomes.</p>    <p>This FOA encourages researchers to focus on communities where HIV is most heavily concentrated. Despite advances in HIV prevention and treatment, substantial disparities in knowledge of and uptake of treatment still exist among populations of underrepresented individuals, which range from HIV diagnoses, to access to and retention in care, antiretroviral (ART) adherence, and virologic suppression.&nbsp;In view of evidence that underrepresented minorities continue to bear a disproportionate share of the burden of HIV, this FOA encourages research in HIV-related disparities as another cross-cutting issue, especially to identify mechanisms underlying disparities and to develop and test intervention targets for the amelioration of such HIV-related health disparities.</p>    <p>Studies are encouraged to better understand and intervene on mental disorders that impact HIV prevention or treatment efforts among highly affected populations and at appropriate junctures along the developmental spectrum. A special emphasis, when supported by evidence, on persons at high risk as defined by age, gender, race-ethnicity, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status is acceptable. For example, women in areas of heavy concentrations of HIV-infected individuals face unique challenges such as perinatal depression (encompassing pregnancy and the first year postpartum).&nbsp; Similarly, there may be differences in settings (e.g.&nbsp; hospital- versus community-based or resource-limited) that are associated with HIV prevention and treatment challenges. These factors may significantly affect who is targeted, how and where research studies are conducted, and what outcomes are assessed. Multi-level factors can include those at the individual, interpersonal, community, or societal level. Outcomes, whenever possible, should be rigorously measured at multiple levels such as self-report, biological, clinical diagnostic, bio-imaging, and administrative.</p>    <p>Multidisciplinary research approaches of interest include basic biological and behavioral social science, longitudinal, intervention and implementation science studies in domestic and international settings. Where relevant and feasible, intervention studies will be randomized clinical trials (RCTs), but other types of trial designs could be used as necessary.</p>    <p>This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages researchers to utilize a developmental perspective that addresses the substantial changes that occur across the lifespan (from infancy through older adulthood) that are associated with HIV prevention and treatment challenges. Additionally, given the complexity of advancing HIV prevention and care research, multidisciplinary and modeling approaches are encouraged that draw appropriately from multiple disciplines to reach solutions based on novel understandings of these complex problems. Teams could include researchers, for example, from the fields of public health, public policy, behavioral and social science, systems science, behavioral economics, health disparities, organizational behavior, demography, choice architecture, neuroscience, genetics, epidemiology and statistics.</p>    <p><strong>Areas of Research Interest</strong></p>    <p>The research areas that are pertinent to this FOA include, but are not limited to:</p>    <p>Basic biological and behavioral social science:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Studies on multi-level factors and pathways between mental disorders and other co-morbidities in HIV risk acquisition or transmission and engagement in HIV care (e.g., linkage and retention to care, ART treatment and adherence, viral load and immunological outcomes, mortality), and to identify modifiable intervention targets.

Furthermore, obesity has increasingly been recognized as a risk factor for asthma.&nbsp; Racial disparities exist for both asthma and obesity prevalence among children and adults. It is unclear as to why this increase persist. The rationale for how this association arises are unresolved to include self-management and achieving control.&nbsp; Because both conditions have their beginnings in early life, an aspect of the association between them that requires more understanding is their common exposures in early life and transition into adulthood.&nbsp; Studies that investigate the links to asthma and obesity are encouraged as well as studies that describe how this relates to self-management.&nbsp; In addition, intervention studies novel or adapted targeting asthma or obesity and their effects on each other and effect on behavior and adherence to management are encouraged.&nbsp; Awareness and self-management will require multiple skills and activities to achieve and maintain control of asthma and sustain health and quality of life. This requires shared responsibilities among multiple stakeholders and new interdisciplinary partnerships.</p>    <p>Asthma is a chronic condition involving the respiratory system in which the airways intermittently constrict, become inflamed, and are lined with excessive amounts of mucus, often in response to one or more triggers. Examples of triggers of asthma include upper respiratory infections, allergens (house dust mites, cockroach, pollens, molds, and animal epithelials), exercise, and cold air. Epidemiologic studies suggest there is a dose-effect relationship between weight and asthma. In the adult, co-morbidities of diseases associated with obesity (e.g., dyslippidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and sleep-disordered breathing) may provoke or worsen asthma. &nbsp;Both asthma and obesity are considered inflammatory conditions. These relationships suggest that obesity and asthma may share a common link. Further understanding of the relationship between obesity and asthma may lead to new therapeutic strategies for treatment in these populations.</p>    <p>In 2015, the number of adults aged 18 and over who currently have asthma was 18.4 million.&nbsp; The percent of adults aged 18 and over who currently have asthma is 7.6%.&nbsp; The number of children under age 18 who currently have asthma is 6.2 million.&nbsp; The percent of children under age 18 years who currently have asthma is 8.4%.&nbsp; The percent of visits to office based providers with asthma indicated on the medical record was 6.3%.&nbsp; The number of visits to emergency departments with asthma as the primary health condition was 2.0 million.&nbsp; The number of deaths was 3,651 and deaths per 100,000 population was 1.1.&nbsp; Significant differences in current asthma prevalence exist between many population subgroups in the US. Higher rates exist among females, children, non-Hispanic black and Puerto Ricans, those with family income below the poverty level, and those residing in the Northeast and Midwest United States.&nbsp; Asthma can involve costs related to health care use and morbidity, including missed work and school days. Even after accounting for prevalence differences between groups, health care use differs among groups. Non-Hispanic black persons have relatively low rates of ambulatory visits compared with their use of urgent health care services, which may represent underuse of preventive services or non-availability of them. Although children have higher health care use than adults, they have much lower death rates. However, because adverse asthma outcomes, including death, are largely preventable, lowering asthma morbidity and mortality rates among people of all ages remains a priority. The large asthma burden and continued adverse outcomes presents an ongoing public health challenge, including the effort to enhance uptake of underutilized management strategies to control symptoms and maintain health and quality of life.</p>    <p>More than one-third (36.5%) of U.S. adults have obesity.&nbsp;&nbsp; The estimated annual medical cost of obesity in the U.S. was $147 billion in 2008 U.S. dollars; the medical costs for people who have obesity were $1,429 higher than those of normal weight. Non-Hispanic blacks have the highest age-adjusted rates of obesity (48.1%) followed by Hispanics (42.5%), non-Hispanic whites (34.5%), and non-Hispanic Asians (11.7%). Obesity is higher among middle age adults age 40-59 years (40.2%) and older adults age 60 and over (37.0%) than among younger adults age 20&ndash;39 (32.3%). State-specific data on adult obesity prevalence using self-reported information from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) shows that obesity prevalence remains high in the United States. Percent of adolescents aged 12-19 years with obesity: was 20.6% Percent of children aged 6-11 years with obesity was17.4%. Percent of children aged 2-5 years with obesity was 9.4% (CDC, 2013-2014)</p>    <p>This will affect self-management recommendations. Previous research focusing on altering dietary habits and physical activity behavior has targeted individuals and not families. These interventions have been generally unsuccessful in establishing long-term behavior changes. A number of environmental influences spanning community, societal, national, and international environments are correlated with an increased prevalence of obesity. These include increased portion sizes, school food and physical activity environments, the built environment (such as sidewalks and street design), the community food environment, high costs of fresh produce and lean meats and fish. Other factors are technological advances leading to reduced requirements for physical activity at work and at home, developments in agriculture and food technology leading to decreased costs of processed food and food products, and marketing of high-calorie foods, especially to children.</p>    <p>Many studies have supported the link between asthma and obesity. Although the evidence favors an association between asthma and obesity, the exact nature of the association remains unclear as well as its management. &nbsp;Also, whether the increase in prevalence of obesity has led to the increase in asthma prevalence remains controversial.&nbsp; Because both conditions have their beginnings in early life, an aspect of the relationship between obesity and asthma and self- management in early life and the transition to adulthood needs to be explored.</p>    <p><strong>Research Objectives</strong></p>    <p>NINR seeks research that builds the science of asthma, obesity, self-management awareness.&nbsp; Examples of approaches to this opportunity include but are not limited to the following:</p>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Test interventions that promote health behaviors for individuals with chronic conditions especially when other family also have chronic conditions and are at risk of exacerbation of their illness.</li>    <li>Identify novel technologies or other approaches for individuals, families, and communities to use that promote health behaviors and accessing/imparting/acting on health information and self-management</li>    <li>Determine and test effective methods for dissemination of interventions into practice and methods to sustain these interventions in the community</li>    <li>Develop outcome measures (short and long term) to assess effectiveness of interventions</li>    <li>Examine the use of decision support and personalized self-management interventions for those with existing health disparities and functional disabilities</li>    <li>Develop and test interventions aimed at helping the individuals, caregivers, families, or supportive others to better fill their role while improving their own health and quality of life</li>    <li>&nbsp;Identify barriers and facilitators to achieving effective control and maintain health and quality of life to inform future self-management interventions</li>    <li>Examine environmental factors, including built environments, diet composition, macro and micronutrient availability, total caloric intake, that may trigger, modulate or play permissive roles in the development of asthma and/or obesity and its role on management</li>    <li>Design intervention studies to determine the impact of weight loss to include self-management in obese&nbsp;individuals with asthma</li>    <li>Examine the gender differences in the prevalence/ etiology/ predisposing factors/&nbsp;self- management/ drug efficacy of obesity and asthma</li>    <li>Determine the possible associations between an asthma-induced low physical activity life style (low energy expenditure) and predilection for obesity and effects on self-management</li>    <li>Examine possible&nbsp;relationships between asthma, sleep disorders, and obesity and self-management behavior</li>    </ul>    </ol>; <div class=""heading2""><strong>Award Information</strong></div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Funding Instrument</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>Grant: A support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Application Types Allowed</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>New&nbsp;<br />Renewal&nbsp;<br />Resubmission</p>    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11116"">OER Glossary</a>&nbsp;and the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide provide details on these application types.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Clinical Trial?</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>Optional: Accepting applications that either propose or do not propose clinical trial(s)</p>    <p><a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=82370"">Need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?</a></p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Funds Available and Anticipated Number of Awards</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>The number of awards is contingent upon NIH appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Award Budget</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>Application budgets are not limited but need to reflect the actual needs of the proposed project.</p>    </div>    </div>    <div class=""row"">    <div class=""col-md-4 datalabel""><strong>Award Project Period</strong></div>    <div class=""col-md-8 datacolumn"">    <p>The scope of the proposed project should determine the project period.

Possible topics may include, but are not limited to: fetal-neonatal transitional cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology, optimizing steps of resuscitation, management of third stage of labor and its effect on the fetus, resuscitation of children with malformations, effect of resuscitation on long-term outcomes and post-resuscitation practices.&nbsp; Applications can include epidemiological studies, studies utilizing fetal-neonatal animal models, computer or other information-technology-based simulations or study designs, clinical observational studies, analyses of pre-existing national or regional datasets, opportunistic studies prospective randomized controlled trials, or any combinations thereof.&nbsp; It is anticipated that the results from well conducted studies will enable translation of knowledge into evidence-based resuscitation practices ensuring a optimal short- and long-term outcomes for all newborn infants and children.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p>The transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life that occurs at the time of birth requires timely anatomic and physiologic adjustments to achieve the conversion from placental gas exchange to pulmonary respiration. This transition is brought about by initiation of air breathing and cessation of the placental circulation.</p>    <p>Although the vast majority of newborn infants do not require intervention to make these transitional changes, the large number of births worldwide means that many infants require some assistance to achieve cardiorespiratory stability each year.</p>    <p>Despite major advances in neonatal care, there are many gaps in our understanding of transitional fetal/neonatal physiology and evidence-based neonatal resuscitation practices.&nbsp; It has long been recognized that appropriate care of the newborn at birth is crucial for facilitating a smooth transition for infants born at all gestations. In term-healthy infants, such a transition will facilitate optimal temperature balance, mother-infant bonding, and good feeding, enabling the timely discharge of a healthy infant along with the mother. In sick infants and children, appropriate resuscitation methods (based on the need) enable stabilization of the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, restoring adequate blood volume and preventing the adverse effects of deviation in acid-base balance and oxygenation and &nbsp; ventilation parameters (avoiding hyper- and hypoxia, and hyper- and hypocarbia).</p>    <p>Although survival from pediatric cardiac arrest is improving in many (but not all) parts of the world, especially in hospital settings, the recognition and early treatment of infants and children with deteriorating conditions remains a priority to prevent cardiac arrest. It has also been recognized that inappropriate resuscitation not only complicates recovery from already existing disease processes (e.g., shock, respiratory distress due to immaturity, meconium aspiration syndrome, persistent pulmonary hypertension, diaphragmatic hernia), but also can cause adverse effects due to the act of&nbsp;resuscitation itself. The latter may manifest as pneumothorax, baro-trauma leading to prolonged ventilator dependency, and injury to the developing brain, kidney, and other vital organs from deviations in oxygenation and abnormalities of acid-base status and circulating blood volume. In addition, little is known regarding the safe, effective dose of many drugs utilized routinely in neonatal&nbsp;and pediatric resuscitation.&nbsp; Furthermore, little research has gone into establishing resuscitation practices for infants born with relatively rare congenital malformations such as congenital heart disease, diaphragmatic hernia, omphalocele and gastroschesis, oro-facial malformations, and mass lesions in the face and neck regions (e.g., cystic hygroma in the neck).</p>    <p>After publication of the 2010 International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science with Treatment Recommendations (CoSTR), it was apparent that several unclear and contentious delivery room and in-hospital resuscitation issues remained. In 2012, the Neonatal Task Force published an article titled &ldquo;Neonatal Resuscitation: In Pursuit of Evidence Gaps in Knowledge,&rdquo; which outlines areas that still require further exploration and understanding. There was no equivalent report for pediatrics. In 2015 there was an updated International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment Recommendations publication which identified knowledge gaps for both neonates and children.</p>    <p>Within the purview of the Pregnancy and Perinatology Branch portfolio, a priority area continues to be research which increases infant survival free from disease and disability alongside the institute&rsquo;s mission&nbsp;of ensuring that ""all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives, free from disease or disability"".

It is restricted to clinical and basic scientists who are transitioning to, or are already in the early stages of, their independent research career. The research should be focused on one or more of the areas within the biomedical and behavioral scientific mission of the NIDCD, specifically: hearing, balance, smell, taste, voice, speech, or language. The expected outcome from projects funded under this mechanism is the acquisition of necessary preliminary data for a subsequent research project grant (R01) application.</p>    <p>The proposed project may or may not be hypothesis-driven since the goal is to collect the necessary preliminary data sufficient to apply for an R01 grant. The project may aid in the formulation of hypotheses and may be milestone-driven or descriptive in scope. Given that the goal is to collect preliminary data, R21 projects may be less immediately impactful or significant compared to the typical R01. It is not an expectation that this R21 project will likely ""move the field forward"" at this stage.</p>    <p>Preliminary data are not required. However, the project should be supported by sufficient information to give confidence to the reviewers that the proposed work is feasible and that data derived from the project would likely be suitable as preliminary data for a subsequent R01 application. If preliminary data are available it is recommended that these be included.</p>    <p>The NIDCD ECR Award R21 may be used by beginning clinical scientists planning a future application for an NIDCD K08 or K23 mentored research career development award to demonstrate the feasibility of the research project to be proposed in their K-award application. Applicants that have already received a K award from NIDCD may reduce their effort on the K-award to no less than 50% (6 person-months based on a 12 month calendar) during the last two years of the K-award in order to become PD/PI on the NIDCD ECR Award R21 (see &nbsp;NIH policy&nbsp;<a href=""http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-08-065.html"">http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-08-065.html</a>). The PD/PI&rsquo;s total level of effort must remain at 75% (9 person-months based on a 12 month calendar) or more across the K-award and the R21 award. &nbsp;Questions regarding eligibility should be addressed prior to beginning to prepare the application by contacting the training staff member listed in Section VII.

This FOA will support non-clinical and preclinical product development activities to advance new medical countermeasures in preparation for, Phase I clinical trial safety studies, ""Good Laboratory Practices"" (GLP) animal model pivotal efficacy studies, and FDA licensure. In support of the overall program goal for the rapid development of safe and effective radiological/nuclear medical countermeasures for clinical use under emergency situations, this FOA encourages the development of products that: 1) mitigate and/or treat the acute radiation syndromes (ARS) and/or the delayed effects of radiation exposures; 2) eliminate internal radionuclide contamination (decorporation); or 3) accurately determine individual radiation exposure levels (biodosimetry).</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p>Very few medical products have been shown to counter the acute and long-term injuries that can result from a nuclear or radiological accident or attack. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, national and global attention regarding the threat of nuclear attacks and concern over illicit trafficking of radioactive materials has increased. Recent non-terrorist related accidents have also increased global and national attention to the need for medical countermeasures, decorporation agents and biodosimetry devices.&nbsp; NIAID, National Institutes of Health (NIH) was given the responsibility by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to identify, characterize and develop new medical countermeasure products against radiological and nuclear incidents that may cause a public health emergency.</p>    <p>In 2005, the NIH published a Strategic Plan and Research Agenda for Medical Countermeasures against Radiological and Nuclear Threats. This agenda includes focused product development of medical countermeasures, ARS mitigators or treatments, radionuclide decorporation agents, and biodosimetry techniques and devices to fill an important Public Health product need and for inclusion in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). In 2012, NIAID updated the strategic plan and research agenda in the Strategic Plan and Research Agenda for Medical Countermeasures Against Radiological and Nuclear Threats Progress Report: 2005&ndash;2011 and Future Research Directions: 2012&ndash;2016. NIAID has also established several contract and grant programs to initiate research and product development efforts. The strategic plan and program efforts can be found&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/radiation-nuclear-countermeasures-program"">here</a>. This funding opportunity will provide additional support for development of promising candidate medical countermeasures and devices.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives</strong></div>    <p><strong>This FOA will support activities leading to the development, preparation and submission of an IND or an IDE for eventual FDA licensure. It is anticipated that in most cases, licensure or approval of proposed medical countermeasures will occur in accordance with the FDA Animal Rule (<a href=""https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=314&amp;showFR=1&amp;subpartNode=21:5.0.1.1.4.9"">see 21 CFR 314.600 Subpart I</a>&nbsp;for drug products and&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=601&amp;showFR=1&amp;subpartNode=21:7.0.1.1.2.8"">21 CFR 601.90 Subpart H</a>for biologic products. Thus, studies in animal models will be required to demonstrate efficacy of the medical countermeasure products. Under the FDA Animal Rule, GLP animal model pivotal efficacy studies serve as surrogates for Phase III clinical efficacy studies. This FOA, however, will NOT support clinical trials or GLP pivotal efficacy studies. Animal studies leading to GLP pivotal studies, including preclinical efficacy studies and GLP-pilot studies, will be supported by this FOA. &nbsp;</strong></p>    <p>The spectrum of development activities supported by this FOA includes proof of concept studies; efficacy work; statistically valid developmental efficacy studies; GLP-pilot studies to inform the design of GLP pivotal efficacy study protocols; non-clinical determination of safety, toxicology and metabolism; formulation development; determination of dose and dose scheduling; cGMP manufacturing scale-up and drug product stability studies; development of GLP analytical methods for efficacy studies; product characterization; and completion of IND or IDE packages for FDA submission.</p>    <p>The priority areas of product development from proof of principle to submission of an IND/IDE package include, but are not limited to, the following examples:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Medical products and regimens that mitigate and/or treat radiation injury post-exposure (i.e., administration of first dose to start at least 24 hours after radiation exposure), with emphasis on broad activity (i.e. multi-syndrome and/or multi-tissue), ease of administration in a mass casualty and emergency scenario; safety; and long shelf-life;</li>    <li>Medical products and regimens that accelerate the removal of inhaled, insoluble particles containing radionuclides from the lungs.

Changes that occur during pregnancy may cause the exacerbation/worsening of pre-existing conditions or the development of new ones. Gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertension, preeclampsia and premature labor complicate a significant percentage of pregnancies and remain some of the major causes of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Gestational diabetes, for example, complicates 5-12% and preeclampsia 3-5% of pregnancies.&nbsp; Despite their high prevalence, drug development for obstetric indications is practically non-existent. There is almost a complete lack of drug development for obstetric indications, with only one new class of drug licensed for obstetric patients in the past 20 years, and no new class of drugs in clinical trials for primary obstetric applications. Reasons for the paucity of new drugs for obstetrics include risk aversion, the cost of reproductive toxicology studies, and perceived small or time-limited market.

These partnerships are intended to enhance relationships in community settings, with the goal of producing better interventions. In turn, these enhanced interventions are expected to lead to positive health outcomes. Partnership is defined as an association of two or more persons or entities that conduct a study as equal co-investigators. Community Engagement (CE) lies on a continuum that reflects the level of involvement of community members, or representatives of community populations, in research. This continuum of involvement in research efforts ranges from community consent to research, to full participation and shared leadership of community members in research design and eventual dissemination and implementation.&nbsp; Advances in translating research findings into practice have been made; however, such advances have not been realized by all members of society according to age, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic group. Narrowing the gap in translational research within the NINR strategic areas of emphasis is a priority for the Institute. Using CE approaches and addressing areas such as self and symptom management, health promotion and prevention is one way to narrow the gap. CE can take many forms, and partners can include community-based groups, agencies such as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Innovation Centers, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Prevention Research Centers, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Community Health Centers (CHC) and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC), other academic health institutions, or individuals. Collaborators may be engaged in health promotion/prevention, clinical or intervention research.</p>    <p>An example NIH program, Partners in Research, was designed to improve public understanding of biomedical and behavioral science, develop strategies for promoting collaboration between scientists and the community to improve the health of the public, and to identify the conditions (e.g., settings and approaches) that enhance the effectiveness of such activities. This program announcement is modeled after approaches like Partners in Research and is intended to promote community partnerships in research, and to provide opportunities to build close collaborations between academic researchers and community members to generate better informed hypotheses, to develop more efficacious and effective interventions, and to enhance the translation of research results into practice.&nbsp; CEnR research methodologies are expected to result in more meaningful academic-community collaborations and relationships, which should also lead to sustainable interventions and improved health of individuals and communities.&nbsp; Investing in community and academic partnerships in research efforts will provide its greatest impact in translating established health care practices in health promotion and prevention and self and symptom management.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives</strong></div>    <p>Responses to this announcement must identify researcher and community partnerships around well-defined health issues of mutual concern. Approaches proposed should incorporate information about sustaining health programs in community settings. Results of the partnership during the project period can include, but are not limited to:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Interventions/programs for health promotion/prevention</li>    <li>Interventions/programs leading to self-management of chronic conditions</li>    <li>Programs that target self or symptom management</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>Any intervention/program identified must also include measurement of explicit health outcomes. These health outcomes should emerge from mutual agreement among the researcher and community partners and, ideally, will be informed by available data about the local community environment.</p>    <p>By using the R21 mechanism, the NIH seeks to foster the introduction of novel scientific ideas, model systems, tools, agents, targets, and technologies that have the potential to substantially advance biomedical research. An R21 grant application needs not have extensive background material or preliminary information.

This initiative will support the development, scaling, and implementation of robust neurobiological assays that can be used to assess changes in nervous system function in response to perturbations.&nbsp; Since the goal is to build scalable assays, capable of ultimately assessing hundreds to thousands of chemical or genetic perturbations or conditions, most measures will be in vitro. However, some model organisms may afford unique advantages to evaluate, for example, genomic, transcriptomic, or proteomic effects in intact systems.</p>    <p>In recent years, the development of technologies has allowed detailed analysis of genomic, biochemical, and cellular processes in health and disease, greatly advancing our understanding of nervous system function at the molecular/cellular level.&nbsp; Coupled with advances in bioinformatics, chemical biology, synthetic chemistry, and protein engineering, these technologies provide a rich knowledge base and toolbox to identify and pursue new targets and strategies for understanding and treating disease.&nbsp; In addition, methods that enhance throughput in terms of the number of samples analyzed in parallel, as well as advances in detection techniques, imaging, and automation, allow for broader, high-content assay measures.&nbsp; For example, NIH initiatives such as the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/"">BRAIN Initiative</a>&nbsp;are building higher throughput tools to interrogate the diversity of cellular biology and to maximize the value of high content data sets emerging from these efforts.&nbsp; Indeed, in fields outside of neuroscience, this expansion of methods and capability has led to breakthroughs using genomic, proteomic, or chemical manipulation in cells, tissues, cell-free preparations, and whole organisms, but, until recently, progress with neurobiological endpoints has been lagging.</p>    <p>Proposed assays should have the potential for enhancement in throughput (number of simultaneous measurements) and/or content (types of measurements), compared to existing methods, though the initial throughput of novel assays may be lower while under development.

Despite some positive outcomes, none of the cannabinoid-based drugs have yet been approved by the FDA for pain treatment. More clinical and mechanism-based basic research is warranted to develop safe and effective cannabinoid-based pain treatments.</p>    <p>Several small trials have demonstrated that cannabis can reduce the sensation of pain, including additive effects over those achieved from concurrent medications.&nbsp; Research is needed to examine cannabis-related compounds as alternative therapies for pain management. Important in this endeavor is to develop a deeper understanding of the role of natural cannabinoids and endocannabinoids in pain perception, processes, and outcomes.&nbsp; Research is also needed to determine how to modulate key endocannabinoid receptors, ligands, and enzyme levels in pain conditions.&nbsp; This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) encourages research project grant (R01) applications that study cannabinoids (phytocannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoids) and the endocannabioid system to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the endocannabinoid system across a variety of pain conditions.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Objectives&nbsp;</strong></p>    <p>The purpose of this NIH Pain Consortium-endorsed FOA is to support projects examining the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids and endocannabinoid system across a variety of pain conditions. &nbsp;Research supported under this FOA is wide-ranging.&nbsp;

This could include the feasibility, tolerability, acceptability and safety of novel or adapted interventions that target HIV prevention or treatment. This award may include (1) the development and/or pilot testing of interventions, including formative mixed-methods research; (2) the adaptation and/or pilot testing of interventions with demonstrated efficacy for use in broader scale effectiveness trials; or (3) innovative implementation science and services research.</p>    <p>For the purposes of this FOA, &ldquo;intervention&rdquo; is defined to include behavioral, social, or structural approaches, as well as combination biomedical and behavioral, social, or structural approaches that prevent acquisition and transmission of HIV infection, or improve clinical outcomes for persons who are HIV infected, or both. It is expected that the interventions developed with support from this FOA will not be solely pharmacologic in nature.</p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent"">(1) Regarding the development and pilot testing of new interventions, the Division of AIDS Research (DAR) at NIMH utilizes the R34 mechanism to target highly innovative approaches for intervention that have the potential to reach those who have not been aided by more conventional HIV prevention and treatment services. For example, DAR strongly encourages strategies that leverage technology and social media, novel mechanisms for behavior change, and approaches that optimize reach and impact through modifications in systems and structures that impede full access and effective use of prevention and treatment services.</p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent"">(2) For research to adapt efficacious interventions, the need for an adapted or extended intervention should be justified in terms of (a) Theoretical and empirical support for the adaptation target (e.g., the adaptation changes a factor that has been associated with non-response, partial response, patient non-engagement, or relapse); (b) Clear explication of the mechanism by which a moderator variable functions to disadvantage or advantage a subgroup (ideally, with behavioral and/ or biological data that support the mechanism hypothesis); and/or (c) Evidence to suggest that the adapted intervention will result in a substantial improvement in response rate, speed of response, an aspect of care, or uptake in community/practice settings when compared to existing intervention approaches.</p>    <p class=""P_SingleIndent"">(3) This FOA is also intended to support innovative implementation science and pilot services research to identify factors that impact access, utilization, quality, and outcomes of service provision. Such research could inform or pilot-test patient-, provider-, organizational-, or policy- level services interventions to improve care quality, coordination, or delivery.</p>    <p>Collection of preliminary data regarding feasibility, acceptability, safety, tolerability, and target outcomes is appropriate. Given the intended pilot nature of the R34 mechanism, conducting formal tests of clinical outcomes or attempting to obtain an estimate of an effect size is often not justified.&nbsp; Given the limited sample sizes typically supportable under this pilot study mechanism, the variability in the effect sizes obtained is often so large as to be unreliable. Thus, using these potentially unstable effect size estimates in power calculations for larger studies, without regard to clinical meaningfulness, is not advisable.</p>    <p>The research proposed should be receptive to the research mission of the Division of AIDS Research (DAR) at NIMH, and HIV/AIDS Research Priorities established by the NIH Office of AIDS Research (OAR). Applicants are encouraged to use the R34 mechanism to address research priorities of the Division of AIDS Research.</p>    <p>This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages researchers to utilize a developmental perspective that addresses the substantial changes that occur across the lifespan (from infancy through older adulthood) that are associated with HIV prevention and treatment challenges. Additionally, given the complexity of advancing HIV prevention and care research, multidisciplinary and modeling approaches are encouraged that draw appropriately from multiple disciplines to reach solutions based on novel understandings of these complex problems. Teams could include researchers, for example, from the fields of public health, public policy, behavioral and social science, systems science, behavioral economics, health disparities, organizational behavior, demography, choice architecture, neuroscience, genetics, epidemiology and statistics.</p>    <p><strong>Specific Areas of Research Interest:</strong></p>    <p>Examples of potential research topics include, but are not limited to:</p>    <p>HIV care continuum</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Studies of novel approaches to maximize HIV testing, linkage to care, retention in care, antiretroviral adherence, and viral suppression</li>    <li>Studies to develop and pilot test novel technology-based interventions to improve health outcomes across the HIV care continuum for youth living with HIV</li>    <li>Studies of behavioral, social, or structural interventions that initiate, improve, and sustain adherence to recommended HIV care or regimens</li>    <li>Studies that elucidate information about HIV-related barriers and needs of populations who have difficulty engaging in and sustaining treatment and prevention care.

According to U.S. Census Bureau estimates in 2012, 14% of the total U.S. population is made up of adolescents aged 10-19, including 41,844,000 youth (21.3 million males and 20.3 million females). In addition, the adolescent population of the U.S. is becoming more ethnically diverse with rapid increases in Hispanics, Asian Americans and other minority racial and ethnic groups.&nbsp; The transition from childhood to adolescence through early adulthood is a developmental stage that may influence future health and disease, and may also reflect underlying reproductive diseases and disorders. Data on duration and timing from menarche to the establishment of normal menstrual cyclicity is sparse; limited data are available regarding norms of pubertal development in male adolescents; and normative data by race and ethnicity are limited in either gender. Establishing norms and normal trajectories with consideration of race, ethnicity and gender throughout adolescence would facilitate earlier diagnosis of abnormal development and implementation of preventive measures and interventions to promote health.</p>    <p>The National Research Council/Institute of Medicine's special committee on adolescent health concluded that &ldquo;The characterization of adolescents and their health status by such traditional measures as injury and illness does not adequately capture the developmental and behavioral health of adolescents of different ages and in diverse circumstances.&rdquo; They identified deficits in available data on adolescent health that limits the ability of health practitioners, policy makers and families to appropriately respond to the specific needs of adolescents. For example, the NIH Evidence-based Methodology Workshop on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome noted that normal ovulation is not completely understood, normative data on androgen levels are not clearly defined and vary with age, and the lack of normative standards of ovarian morphology across the menstrual cycle and by age, notably in adolescence, are limiting factors for appropriate diagnosis. The expert panel recommended improved methods and criteria to assess androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction and normal vs. polycystic ovarian morphology, and to define normal ranges for different ethnic groups/populations and across age groups.</p>    <p>Limited longitudinal data exist in the knowledge base of menarche, pubarche and pubertal development of various minorities and ethnic groups, and on the influences of lifestyle factors and environmental exposures on sexual development. Innovative tools and approaches are needed for the investigation and analysis of the adolescent reproductive transition to adulthood that would advance knowledge in this area.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives</strong></div>    <p>The main objective of this initiative is to create innovative tools and approaches that will advance the study of the adolescent reproductive transition, and enhance elucidation of trajectories of progression towards adult reproductive function. Investigation of norms of various aspects of adolescent health concurrently and over time, in the context of socioeconomic, geographic or cultural influences will inform understanding of adolescent health and disease.New scientific tools and methodologies, including smart phones, internet apps, exercise and sleep monitoring devices, hormonal assays including mass spectrometry for androgen levels, improved imaging and ultrasound technology among others, are potential building blocks to enable more precise research on the pubertal transition. Development of new tools and approaches will stimulate the quality and comprehensiveness of data collection and analysis.</p>    <div class=""heading4"">Research Scope</div>    <p>Research topics that may be addressed in response to this FOA include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Development of innovative tools and technologies to measure menstrual cycle characteristics such as bleeding, pain, menstrual irregularity during the peripubertal transition to facilitate establishment of normal ranges across the age spectrum and across populations.</li>    <li>Longitudinal assessment of gender-based norms of pubertal progression and sexual development in adolescent and young adults by age and trajectory in of various ethnic and racial groups and in different populations.</li>    <li>Methods to accurately measure reproductive hormones and biomarkers to enable characterization of the pattern, timing, level and trajectory of reproductive biomarkers through the adolescent transition to adulthood from age 9-18, including normal ranges for different ethnic groups and age ranges in males and females.</li>    <li>Development of ultrasound and other non-invasive technologies to assess normal and abnormal anatomic, morphologic and biochemical characteristics across adolescence with regard to age, ethnicity and race.</li>    <li>Development of tools that capture the effects of lifestyle factors such as obesity, stress, sleep, environmental pollutants, drugs and alcohol on pubertal progression.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>Information and data collected from people aged 19 and above via retrospective recall is not within scope of this FOA.

New opportunities in clinical translation could arise from the discovery of potential new therapeutic effects of already-approved drugs.&nbsp;The current scientific literature suggests that metformin may have additional, previously unrecognized therapeutic effects against age-related conditions and warrants further attention in translational aging research. Initially approved for treatment of Type 2 diabetes, it has now been shown to be effective in Type 2 diabetes prevention. Over the past few years, data from clinical studies of metformin in a variety of patient populations suggest that it may have other effects, besides being an antihyperglycemic agent. For example, there is some clinical evidence that metformin may have cardioprotective effects (e.g., reduce proinflammatory factors, improve lipid profiles, improve endothelial cell function, slow progression of coronary artery calcification). There is also evidence that it may contribute to prevention of some forms of human cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, colon). However, additional studies are necessary to determine if the potential cardioprotective and antineoplastic effects of metformin are direct (glucose or insulin-independent) or secondary effects through restoration of glucose and insulin levels. &nbsp;</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Evidence from animal models and in vitro studies suggest that metformin may also influence metabolic and cellular processes associated with the development of chronic conditions of old age, including inflammation, oxidative damage, increased glycation of proteins, diminished autophagy, cell senescence and apoptosis. However, many of these effects of metformin have been observed in pre-clinical studies using doses/concentrations of metformin which far exceed therapeutic levels in humans. Further investigations of metformin at clinically relevant doses/levels will be needed to better understand the translational potential of metformin for the prevention or treatment of chronic conditions of old age.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Though not fully understood, the pleiotropic effects of metformin are thought to be mediated primarily through inhibition of mitochondrial complex 1 (i.e., effects on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and cellular energy charge) and, in part, through regulation of the activity of 5&rsquo;adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).&nbsp;Thus metformin has been of interest in experimental aging research because these pathways have been implicated in the modulation of life span and health span in animal models, as well as risk or progression of specific age-related conditions in animal models. Furthermore, metformin has been noted to have some effects similar to those of caloric restriction, which extends life span and health span in many, but not all, experimental animal models. Thus drugs that affect several processes or outcomes are of particular interest in clinical translational research in aging since they may exert their effects by influencing fundamental aging factors that underlie multiple age-related conditions.&nbsp;Information on this range of effects of metformin could have translational value either by directly suggesting alternative, new clinical uses for preventing or ameliorating age-related diseases, or leading to the identification of potential new therapeutic targets for which new compounds could be developed.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">Insight into alternative, clinical effects of metformin on a broader range of age-related changes in disease risk factors and incidence of clinical outcomes can be gained through the conduct of small-scale physiological studies (including ancillary projects to ongoing clinical trials) and/or through secondary analyses of data and biospecimens generated from existing controlled clinical studies of metformin. Numerous controlled clinical trials and other controlled human studies of metformin monotherapy (i.e., placebo-controlled versus metformin-only treatment) have been completed or are in progress to examine effects on specific outcomes in a variety of patient populations. Data and stored samples from these studies could be leveraged to address factors contributing to heterogeneity of responses to metformin treatment within a given patient population, as well as questions regarding the effects of metformin and their mechanisms of action(s) under various conditions (e.g., hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, proinflammatory conditions). Moreover, some of the existing clinical studies are prevention or risk factor studies, rather than treatment studies, thus providing an opportunity to assess such effects in persons free of potential complicating effects of conditions that are themselves potential targets of metformin. It is also worth noting that clinical trials of metformin have included individuals of varying age ranges, including children. This allows analyses to explore possible age-related differences in the effects of metformin on aging changes and risk factors at different stages of the life span.&nbsp;</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives</strong></div>    <p class=""regulartext"">The objective of this FOA is to support research projects that include small-scale physiologic studies in humans or utilize secondary analyses to increase our understanding about the clinical translational potential of metformin to delay deleterious aging changes or to extend healthy human life span.&nbsp;This includes identification of specific populations particularly likely to benefit (i.e., in diabetic, as well non-diabetic populations), and/or obtaining information on metformin&rsquo;s human physiologic and cellular effects that would be useful in identifying novel molecular targets.</p>    <p class=""regulartext"">For those proposing projects utilizing secondary analyses, the principal focus of this FOA is on analyses of data sets and/or stored samples from controlled clinical studies of metformin monotherapy (i.e., placebo-controlled versus metformin-only treatment).

Individuals living in remote locations have historically had poor access to care, due to travel distances and unavailable services. Individuals living in more concentrated population centers also suffer from poor or insufficient care, due to lack of education about available and needed care, limited resources, and poor transportation options. The current age of advanced information technology offers opportunities for wide reach of healthcare delivery to patients. Remote and other forms of technological care have increased notably in the US and internationally, but their public health benefit has not been fully realized. Increased access to care for underserved populations and greater variety in ways for patients to receive care are needed.</p>    <p>A wide range of technological approaches to enhance public health for the purpose of reaching hard-to-serve, difficult-to-reach populations have been implemented and studied. Telehealth or telemedicine (i.e., remote healthcare services, clinical or non-clinical, that deliver, diagnose, consult, treat, transfer, and serve to educate the health community, including providing provider training and medical education) have been prevalent in supporting clinical care.&nbsp; To date, most of the technology-focused research that exists is understood in terms of the type, nature and delivery of healthcare. For example, the nursing field has focused on using technology to deliver nursing care, &ldquo;telehealth nursing,&rdquo; and to conduct nursing practice.</p>    <p>Though research studies have incorporated technology in a range of ways, a missing component to the research is attention to patient outcomes.

The 2014 IOM report, Dying in America, highlighted the problem of transitions, their effect on quality of care and how lack of care coordination and continuity can lead to unwanted care, a situation that benefits neither the individual, the family, the provider nor society. Most Americans would choose to die at home if they had a terminal illness. Hospice care in the US most frequently occurs in the individual&rsquo;s place of residence, usually their home, but there are inconsistencies in coordination of care across hospices which are demonstrated by variability in the number and types of transitions experienced by hospice patients and their families. Research has highlighted the increasing number and type of transitions, such as changes in care providers and settings which occur while the individual is under the care of the hospice. Two types of transition are of interest for this FOA: 1) Transitions across settings while remaining under hospice care, including; transitions to other care settings such as an acute care hospital, a skilled nursing home, a residential living facility, or an inpatient hospice facility, and 2). Transitions out of the hospice, commonly called &ldquo;live discharge&rdquo; from hospice. Live discharges are usually due to the individual no longer meeting eligibility criteria or choosing to revoke hospice services. There are regional variations in the live discharge rate and differences by type or size of the hospice program and across racial groups and genders.</p>    <p>There is a paucity of research on the effects of these transitions or of high quality care coordination at the individual and family level. It is particularly important to understand how transitions in care affect communication of the individual and family preferences and values. Interventions and models of care coordination that have been successful in improving individual outcomes in other populations and settings need to be tested in the hospice population. Successful interventions and models of care that improve individual and family outcomes in hospice need quick implementation and dissemination and should be sensitive to cultural and ethnic variation across populations.</p>    <p>Expanding our understanding of which aspects of care transitions and coordination of care at the end of life have the most impact on individuals and families will provide the foundation for innovative clinical interventions and models of care that will best meet the supportive and end-of-life care needs of individuals and families (NINR Innovative Questions in End-of-Life and Palliative Care 4-10&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ninr.nih.gov/newsandinformation/iq/eolpc-workshop#.V9BgPpX2bmQ"">https://www.ninr.nih.gov/newsandinformation/iq/eolpc-workshop#.V9BgPpX2bmQ</a>&nbsp;) and align with individual and family caregiver goals (NINR Innovative Questions in End-of-Life and Palliative Care 4-2).</p>    <p>By using the R21 mechanism, the NIH seeks to foster the introduction of novel scientific ideas, model systems, tools, agents, targets, and technologies that have the potential to substantially advance biomedical research.

BPSD are often the greatest challenge in the care of advanced dementia patients. If not effectively addressed, BPSD can lead to accelerated functional decline, decreased quality of life, and earlier nursing home placement. The underlying causes for BPSD are complex and multifactorial, and as such challenges exist in determining the optimal prevention/treatment strategy. Pharmacological approaches (such as antipsychotic medication) are commonly used to treat BPSD, however, these medications are not always effective and may additionally carry risks of their own. BPSD impact not only the person with dementia, but also the well-being and quality of life of caregivers and other family members, who may as a result experience their own adverse outcomes such as increased distress and burden.</p>    <p>Several studies have addressed unmet needs and the association of such needs with BPSD. Frequently reported unmet needs include unalleviated pain, discomfort, and sleep problems (physical needs) and loneliness, boredom, and lack of activities that are aligned with a person&rsquo;s interests and cognitive ability (environmental or social needs).&nbsp; For example, although persons with dementia are commonly afflicted with chronic conditions that result in pain or other symptoms, such individuals&nbsp; (especially those in an advanced stage of dementia) cannot adequately describe symptom experiences, leading to under-treatment and seemingly unrelated problematic behaviors (such as verbal aggression). Similarly, a changing environment and lack of meaningful engagement can lead to feelings of isolation and boredom and behaviors such as agitation and wandering. Informal caregivers (which may include spouses, partners, family members, friends, or neighbors) are frequently on the &ldquo;front line&rdquo; of care of persons with dementia that reside in the community, and as such, it is essential that these caregivers possess the knowledge and tools to recognize and address BPSD and their potential causes or triggers.</p>    <p>Non-pharmacological (behavioral) interventions designed to address unmet needs (such as the Tailored Activities Program) have shown promise for reducing BPSD, but additional research is needed to better understand the underlying factors (including patient, caregiver, and environmental factors) and mechanisms of BPSD and to develop targeted, home- or community-based interventions that address unmet needs and reduce BPSD in a way that accommodates the person with dementia and his/her family&rsquo;s preferences. It is anticipated that the results of this research will improve the quality of life in persons with dementia and their caregivers, and delay placement in nursing home facilities.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives</strong></div>    <p>Research projects of interest include, but are not limited to, those that address:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Types of unmet needs and how such needs associate with BPSD</li>    <li>Patient, caregiver, cultural, social, and environmental factors that play a role in the expression of BPSD</li>    <li>Biological underpinnings, mechanisms, and biomarkers associated with BPSD</li>    <li>Role of circadian rhythm disturbances in the timing and manifestation of BPSD</li>    <li>Approaches to help caregivers, family members, and those in the community (e.g., neighbors and other community members) recognize and address BPSD and their underlying causes</li>    <li>Non-pharmacological (behavioral) interventions -particularly those that can be implemented in home or community settings- which address unmet needs (for example, by promoting engagement of the person with dementia with other individuals or the environment) and prevent or reduce BPSD; take into account culture, preferences, interests, and cognitive capacity in intervention design</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p>Interdisciplinary collaborations that include nurse scientists in the project team are strongly encouraged.</p>    <p>This FOA is intended to encourage clinical studies only; it is not intended for studies in animal models.&nbsp; Studies using drugs or biologics, dietary supplements, herbal medicines, or other complementary and alternative interventions are also not appropriate.

However, given the intended pilot nature of the R34 activity code, conducting formal tests of outcomes or attempting to obtain an estimate of an effect size may not be feasible.</p>    <p>The specific goal of this FOA is to support pilot work that might support the design and implementation of a subsequent larger scale project to:&nbsp; 1) develop a service system intervention that coordinates risk identification, evaluation, and linkage to needed treatment and services for justice-involved youth; 2) test the feasibility and effectiveness of the intervention in detecting and responding to vulnerable youth at and across various points within juvenile justice and relevant community settings; and 3) demonstrate the intervention's implementation and potential for future uptake in diverse settings across the U.S.&nbsp; The ultimate goal of this and the companion FOA is to develop and test the effectiveness of empirically based, integrated, and scalable strategies for detecting and preventing suicidal behavior, ideation and self-harm among justice-involved youth.&nbsp; The focus is on systems interventions to improve outcomes for youth and is not intended to support the development of new screening tools or assessment instruments.&nbsp;</p>    <p>This FOA uses the R34 activity code and runs in parallel to a companion R01 FOA,&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-16-299.html"">PAR-16-299</a>, which supports empirical testing of intervention strategies in future full-scale trials in this topic area.&nbsp; Opportunity for detection and prevention of suicidal behavior, suicidal ideation, and non-suicidal self-harm (NSSI) starts at early points of justice system contact (e.g., police encounters or intake interview), and continues through many juvenile justice settings (e.g., pre-trail detention; juvenile or family court hearings; court disposition; placement, community treatment and service settings.)&nbsp; Because nearly 90% of justice-involved youth reside in the community rather than in detention, community-based points of intervention are likely to play a significant role in effective intervention strategies, and might include:&nbsp; behavioral or primary health care settings, educational or vocational settings, family services, etc.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Collaboration with multiple stakeholders (eg: case managers, parole or probation officers, school counselors, peer-counselors, family members, program managers, policy leaders, etc.) can contribute to shaping interventions that can be feasibly delivered and have likelihood of rapid scale-up.&nbsp; The ability to link justice, educational and/or health care data systems may enable assessment of the efficiency and full impact of interventions.&nbsp; The potential for the intervention to reduce disparities in outcomes among under-served groups should be addressed, where appropriate.</p>    <p>Prospective applicants are encouraged to communicate with the listed&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-18-228.html#_Scientific/Research_Contact(s)"">Scientific/Research Contact</a>&nbsp;for additional guidance</p>;

Fifty to sixty percent of deaths among HIV-infected persons will occur from these non-AIDS causes.</p>    <p>A variety of co-morbid diseases and conditions may arise in persons with long-standing HIV infection, including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, renal impairment, metabolic bone disease, liver disease, HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) and others.&nbsp; People living with prolonged HIV infection exhibit many of the clinical characteristics commonly observed in the elderly, such as multiple co-morbidities, polypharmacy, physical and cognitive impairment, functional decline, alterations in body composition, and increased vulnerability to stressors.&nbsp; Little is known about the unique manifestation of symptom clustering among those with long-standing HIV infection and in this complex population, HIV infection may be undiagnosed.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Reduced functional capacity, as a result of these comorbidities, combined with premature aging due to HIV infection, increases vulnerability and reduces a person&rsquo;s ability to recover from episodic chronic disease crises and to maintain function and meaningful engagement in daily life.&nbsp; In addition, social stigma and other cultural issues may discourage active seeking of solutions and motivation to manage symptoms and maintain functional capacity and social engagement.

In agreement, the Treatment Episode Data Set reveals a consistent increase in treatment admissions among older adults since 2003. These trends are accompanied by rising deaths due to drug overdoses among those approximately in this same age group. While the baby boomer cohort (individuals born between 1946 to 1964) likely contributes to the increasing share of older adults using illicit drugs, population projections suggest that drug use during older age may be problematic for other cohorts as well. New findings from the 2014 United States Census Bureau Population Projections indicate that the number of Americans aged 65 and over is expected to grow to approximately 98 million individuals and the number of Americans aged 85 and older is expected to grow to approximately 20 million by 2060. Americans are living longer lives, which provides more opportunities to use and potentially abuse prescription drugs and marijuana. These projected increases in life expectancy suggest that we are entering an era where drug use in older populations may become increasingly common.</p>    <p>Evolving medical and recreational marijuana legalization have transformed the availability of marijuana in states impacted by these policies. To date, eight states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana use and 20 more states permit cannabis use for medicinal purposes. Over half of the United States population now resides in a state where some form of marijuana use is legal. Individuals in these states are less likely to report that marijuana use is harmful, and longitudinal data suggest an increase in marijuana use among older adults from 2008 to 2012. Interestingly, patient expenditures from 2010 to 2013 for FDA-approved prescription drugs under the Medicare Part D Plan dropped in states with legalized medical marijuana use. This emerging trend suggests that older adults may be substituting prescription drugs with marijuana. With recent shifts in marijuana legalization policy, there is potential for marijuana consumption to increase across all age groups, including adults over the age of 50. However, compared to adolescents and young adults, the health consequences stemming from marijuana use are currently unknown for older adults.</p>    <p>Compared with younger adults, adults over the age of 50 represent the largest consumers of prescription medications, and individuals in this age group are three times more likely to be prescribed opioids and benzodiazepines. Individuals over 50 report using these prescription drugs to alleviate pain, sleep disorders/insomnia, and anxiety. Opioid and benzodiazepine use by older adults is associated with increased incidence of falls, respiratory failure, sedation, confusion, and cognitive impairments. Similar to marijuana use, the percentage of opioid and benzodiazepine use in this age group has doubled since 2007. Prescription drug use patterns during older age are more problematic for women as they are prescribed these drugs more often, consume them in larger quantities, and use them for longer durations of time. These prescribing practices in older patients can be problematic and may pose a severe health risk. A recent one-year retrospective study revealed that a third of participants over the age of 60 were using at least one potentially inappropriate medication, defined as medications with risks that outweigh the potential benefits of the drug. Since prescription drugs will continue to be incorporated into health care plans for individuals over 50, more information is needed to characterize the health outcomes associated with opioid and benzodiazepine use in older adults.</p>    <p>Increased drug use among older adults can be complicated by other normal changes that occur during healthy aging. For example, drug metabolism rate decreases with age, which may lead to unintended outcomes and other adverse health consequences. Of particular relevance to this funding announcement, the brain also undergoes significant neuroadaptations during aging. After the age of 40, the brain loses approximately 5% of its volume per decade, with some data suggesting an accelerated rate of volume loss at the age of 70. Reduced brain volume predominately occurs in the temporal lobes, cerebellum, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Within these brain regions, cellular and molecular data indicate alterations in dendritic branching and reductions in the number of axodendritic synapses. Post-mortem brain analyses reveal decreased D1 and D2 receptor expression, reduced dopamine synthesis, and diminished receptor and dopamine transporter binding during older age. Additionally, age-related alterations in serotonin and acetylcholine release and neurotransmitter receptor expression have also been observed in adults over the age of 50. The aging-related changes seen in these brain regions are important, given their roles in cognitive function, decision-making, reward processing, and emotional regulation, which all have significant implications for daily life. Currently, there is a lack of knowledge on how marijuana, opioids, or benzodiazepines impact these changing brain systems and their associated behavioral and psychological processes during aging.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Purpose</strong></div>    <p>Given the potentially serious consequences of drug use in later life, it is important to understand the antecedent factors and subsequent outcomes associated with marijuana and prescription opioid and benzodiazepine use in older individuals. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the National Institute on Aging (NIA) have forged a collaborative partnership to support innovative research that improves our understanding of the predictors of marijuana, opioid, or benzodiazepine use in later life, as well as the consequences of these drugs on the aging brain and associated behavioral and public health outcomes. While older adults abuse and use many substances with psychoactive properties, the intended emphasis of this funding opportunity is on marijuana or prescription opioids or benzodiazepines. This initiative will focus on two distinct older adult populations (over the age of 50): (1) individuals with earlier drug use onset who are now entering older age, or (2) individuals who initiate drug use after the age of 50. Insights gained from this initiative have the potential to inform the public and health care systems regarding cannabis and prescription drug use in older populations.</p>    <div class=""heading4"">Research Focus</div>    <p>Applicants are encouraged to focus on exploring predictors and/or outcomes related to prescription drugs (opioids and benzodiazepines) or marijuana use in older adults. Two different populations are suggested for investigation: (1) individuals with drug use onset prior to the age of 50 who are now entering this period of older development; or (2) older adults with limited prior drug use who initiate drug use after the age of 50. For the purposes of this FOA, it is recommended that applications examine a broad range of adult ages over 50 years of age. This initiative will support epidemiological investigations, clinical studies in humans, and basic science research in animal models of substance use disorder. Whenever possible, epidemiological studies are encouraged to use datasets with information collected from earlier in the life course to better identify the diverse predictors of drug use in later life. Research relevant for this funding opportunity may also employ animal models that reflect the neuroadaptations and cognitive/behavioral processes that are observed during later stages of adult development. Mechanistic studies are encouraged to include a younger adult control group to determine if observations in older adults are unique to this later stage of development.

A large number of animal genetic stocks, including models of human diseases, have been generated at an unprecedented fast pace due to rapidly evolving gene editing technologies. However, this rapid increase in genetic stocks is creating challenges in sustainability of the resources, i.e., how to maintain and preserve these critical resources in reliable, cost-effective and long-term ways. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has invested a substantial amount of funding to generate and maintain these resources in dedicated stock centers that serve the biomedical research community. The fruit fly (<em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>) and the zebrafish (<em>Danio rerio</em>) are two of the leading non-mammalian model organisms used for the understanding of basic biology of animal systems and modeling human diseases; however, cryogenic approaches in these species have not been fully established and, in many cases, have proven to be unsuccessful.&nbsp;<em>Drosophila</em>&nbsp;and zebrafish have become increasingly important as biological resources because of their small size, relatively short generation time, easy manipulation of embryos and optical transparency as well as genetic tractability. Both are important for studies in diverse scientific areas, including genetics, pharmacology, toxicology, neurobiology, behavior and developmental biology. Currently there are over 60,000&nbsp;<em>Drosophila</em>&nbsp;stocks at the NIH-supported Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center and nearly 11,000 fish-lines (live and preserved) at the Zebrafish International Resource Center, respectively, but these numbers are increasing at a rapid pace. There is an urgent need to achieve simple, reliable, reproducible and cost-effective methods for cryogenic or long-term preservation and revival of&nbsp;<em>Drosophila</em>&nbsp;and zebrafish stocks, where preservation options are essentially absent (fruit fly) or limited (zebrafish), as compared to the cryopreservation methods developed and widely used for several other animal models, such as worms, mice and rats; and to ensure efficient, and reproducible maintenance and revival of their genetic stocks.</p>    <p>ORIP convened two workshops to offer a forum for discussion of major scientific developments and road blocks that prevent preservation of any stage of fruit fly or beyond sperm for zebrafish (see&nbsp;<a href=""https://orip.nih.gov/sites/default/files/Cryopres%20workshop%20report%20final%2012-28-16.pdf"">Cryopreservation of Drosophila Strains</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://orip.nih.gov/sites/default/files/17_Cryopreservation%20of%20Aquatic%20Biomedical%20Models%20Workshop%20Report_Sept.pdf"">Cryopreservation of Aquatic Biomedical Models Workshop</a>&nbsp;Final Reports).

The overall goal of this FOA is to evaluate the benefit of Traceback testing of women with a personal or family history of ovarian cancer and reaching out to family members to identify unaffected individuals at increased risk for cancer.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p>Women with pathogenic&nbsp;<em>BRCA1/2</em>&nbsp;mutations have a 45-65% risk of developing breast cancer and a 11%-59% risk of developing ovarian cancer by age 70 years. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend genetic counseling for&nbsp;<em>BRCA1/2</em>&nbsp;mutation testing to all women diagnosed with ovarian cancer. However, opportunities to counsel and test individuals at high-risk of carrying&nbsp;<em>BRCA1/2</em>&nbsp;mutations are often missed, especially among minority groups. Only ~20% of cancer patients at high-risk of&nbsp;<em>BRCA1/2</em>mutations undergo genetic testing, with lower percentages among women diagnosed with ovarian cancer. This modest uptake of testing likely reflects a lack of referral, access, and follow-through by patients. It is estimated that only 48,700 of over 348,000 women who are&nbsp;<em>BRCA1/2</em>&nbsp;mutation carriers have been identified, 220,000 of which have not been diagnosed with cancer. These findings highlight missed opportunities for cancer prevention and risk management through breast cancer screening, prophylactic mastectomy and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy.</p>    <p>To address these missed opportunities, NCI developed research questions associated with a ""Traceback""-type program to improve detection of families at risk for beast/ovarian cancer by identifying and genetically testing previously diagnosed but un-referred ovarian cancer patients (<a title=""Link to Non-U.S. Government Site"" href=""http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2016.70.3439"">http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2016.70.3439</a>). Failure to identify mutation carriers among probands represents a lost opportunity to prevent cancer in unsuspecting relatives through risk-reduction intervention in mutation carriers, and provide appropriate reassurances to non-carriers. Traceback leverages limited resources by using medical records and pathology specimens as well as community and individual education to identify previously diagnosed probands and engage family members with limited awareness of genetic risk. Additionally, Traceback could provide an opportunity to reach families from rural areas and racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups that historically have not sought or been offered genetic counseling and testing, thereby contributing to a reduction in health disparities in women with germline&nbsp;<em>BRCA1/2</em>&nbsp;mutations.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Scope</strong></div>    <p>The scope of this FOA includes genetics and other clinical projects that will improve the identification of individuals at high risk for cancer. The research scope of this FOA covers 3 major areas that are necessary to understand the feasibility and best approaches to undertake Traceback testing:&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>1) How to identify probands to reach untested individuals and their families?</strong></p>    <p>Germline&nbsp;<em>BRCA1/2</em>&nbsp;mutations are present in 15% of epithelial ovarian cancers, providing an efficient sentinel cancer to detect carriers among family members. Once identified, a carrier provides an entry point for reaching family members who could potentially benefit from genetic counseling, genetic testing and interpretation of results, and appropriate risk-management strategies.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Approaches for identifying previously diagnosed probands include: 1) searching pathology records or tumor registry databases; 2) community engagement campaigns and 3) self-referral based on family (and/or personal) cancer history.</p>    <p><em>Research questions of interest for this component include but are not limited to:</em></p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Which approaches are most effective for identifying and testing potential carriers given the ethical issues (e.g. obtaining consent) and logistical issues (e.g. proband's vital status and ability to contact) that would be faced in various clinical and community contexts?</li>    <li>What are the best approaches to recruit, counsel and test rural and/or minority populations? What cultural considerations need to be addressed when working with racially/ethnically diverse populations and/or rural communities? How does acceptability of these approaches differ between different races or socioeconomic populations?</li>    <li>How does community engagement impact acceptability/uptake of genetic testing?</li>    <li>How does the availability of tissue blocks differ across different sites and how does the availability of tissue blocks affect the testing rates of family members? What is the availability of tissue blocks from racially/ethnically diverse cases and how does it reflect the patient population?</li>    <li>What are the limitations of testing FFPE specimens and how can they be overcome to improve testing performance?</li>    <li>What is the accuracy of self-referrals with respect to original diagnosis of proband or level of risk for family members?</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><strong>2) What is the scope of genetic testing and which results should be reported?</strong></p>    <p>Uncertainties exist regarding the important issue of genetic counseling and testing, and what findings to report.

These considerations may vary with the design of the protocol and in accordance with local, state, national and institutional mandates and applicable laws. Accordingly, applicants should conduct research addressing ethical and legal issues raised by their protocol, including approaches for resolving state and national privacy restrictions.</p>    <p><em>Research questions of interest for this component include but are not limited to:</em></p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>What are the institute-, locality-, state- and country-specific laws, informed by ethical and privacy concerns, that impact Traceback cascade testing? How do various Traceback approaches navigate these laws?</li>    <li>What are effective approaches to contact previously diagnosed cases that are still alive and/or next-of kin/personal representatives of deceased cases for consent? What cultural considerations need to be addressed to make these approaches effective in specific clinical and community contexts, including racially/ethnically diverse populations and rural communities?</li>    <li>What is the acceptability of contacting previously diagnosed cases and/or next-of kin/personal representative for consent? What factors impact the acceptability of contact?</li>    <li>What are the best approaches to improve genetic counseling and cascade testing, particularly in rural and/or minority populations (e.g. remote counseling options, telemedicine)? What sustainability factors will be implemented or leveraged to ensure that genetic counseling is available for all populations?</li>    <li>How will genetic counselors communicate with populations who do not speak or understand English?

Initial response to alcohol ingestion, sometimes known as sensitivity, may predict AUD development later in life. Low sensitivity is associated with high probability of developing an AUD. Following initial exposure, responses to alcohol change with subsequent drinking. Alcohol tolerance is a complex phenomenon in which increased alcohol intake is required to achieve a given effect, e.g., the feeling of intoxication, and is a defining feature of AUD. Stated in another way, tolerance decreases the effect of a defined alcohol dose, and reflects individual differences in sensitivity to pharmacologic effects of alcohol and physiological adaptation to alcohol exposure.</p>    <p>Responses to alcohol and the propensity to develop AUD vary significantly within and across populations, and are greatly influenced by family history of AUD. Family linkage and genome-wide association studies identified numerous candidate genes and genetic variations implicated in and contributing to alcohol sensitivity and tolerance. Candidate genes include gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, serotonin transporter, opioid receptor, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, as well as those for alcohol-metabolizing enzymes. Yet, their contribution to individual variation in alcohol sensitivity and tolerance and their contribution to underlying biological mechanisms remain largely unknown. This is in part because: 1) study cohorts vary in age, sex, previous alcohol exposure history, drinking context, and 2) response variables are often subjective, while objective measures are not comparable between studies.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Rodents and invertebrate animals provide powerful genetic models for determining functional relevance of candidate genes identified in human studies. Combined dataset analyses from single gene studies, gene mapping studies, gene expression, and pathway analysis in model organisms have corroborated the findings in humans, identified additional candidate genes, and provided biological context regarding networks of interacting genes and cellular signaling pathways. However, studies in animal models thus far have not led to definite assignment of causality to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within candidate genes and genomic regions despite high degrees of concordance and conservation across the species.</p>    <p>Another layer of complexity is that mechanisms underlying alcohol sensitivity and tolerance also involve processes related to genetic factors that do not manifest as DNA sequence changes within candidate genes and genomic regions. Epigenetic changes in chromatin structure due to DNA methylations and histone modifications regulate gene expression and thus may play an important role in mediating alcohol effects. Little is known about epigenetic mechanisms that result&nbsp;<a name=""_Hlk499031066""></a>in heritable gene expression changes in specific brain regions and organ systems that govern the behavioral consequences related to tolerance and AUD.</p>    <p>Mechanisms underlying sensitivity and tolerance to alcohol are not well known, since alcohol responses are complex, multifactorial, and influenced both by genetic factors and environmental variables such as drinking context and stress exposure. Various studies have revealed different aspects of the genetic underpinnings of alcohol effects. Combining and integrating our knowledge from human genetic studies with information from studies of model organisms will be a productive strategy for investigating gene x gene (G x G), gene x environment (G x E) interactions, and epigenetic contributions to the underlying genetic mechanisms.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Research Objectives</strong></p>    <p>The overall objective of this FOA is to provide enhanced understanding of genetic, genomic, and epigenetic factors contributing to biological processes for individual variation in sensitivity, the development of tolerance, and progression to AUD. The projects under this FOA will develop innovative strategies integrating both experimental and bioinformatics approaches to establish causality for candidate genes from GWAS and linkage studies and to provide insights into genetic mechanisms of alcohol sensitivity and the development of tolerance through investigation of genomic, epigenetic, or transcriptional variation, and gene network and pathway analyses.

Research supported by this FOA will help address gaps in our knowledge and could encourage development of improved local and systemic therapies for HIV-related oral infections and other complications in the era of combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART).&nbsp;</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p>There are nearly 37 million people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) around the world. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately two million new infections occurred in 2015. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that the number of infants newly infected with HIV in low and middle-income countries was at 240,000 in 2013. At least a third of these cases are due to continuous breastfeeding and viral transfer across the oral mucosa and tonsillar tissue. The mechanisms of this transfer are not fully understood.</p>    <p>cART has reduced the morbidity and substantially decreased the mortality associated with HIV infections. Some oral mucosal diseases that were closely associated with low CD4 count and higher plasma viral load, such as oral candidiasis and hairy leukoplakia, are less frequent in patients on cART. However, other conditions such as oral and salivary gland diseases associated with HIV and human papilloma virus (HPV) have not decreased in frequency in PLWH on cART. The reasons these conditions have not decreased in prevalence with cART has not been elucidated.</p>    <p>Severe forms of periodontitis and dental caries are reported in PLWH, along with changes in oral microbiota. However, it is unclear if these changes in the microbiota are responsible for oral disease severity. Some reports also indicate that PLWH develop immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) that is manifested as Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome-like symptoms, with xerostomia and inflammation of the salivary glands.</p>    <p>Selected oral malignancies in PLWH are reported to be related to enhanced local and systemic inflammatory states and are closely linked to other viral conditions, such as Epstein Barr virus and Kaposi&rsquo;s sarcoma herpes virus.

Important problems include enteropathy and loss of gastrointestinal homeostasis; liver diseases and viral hepatitis coinfections; kidney, urologic, and hematologic diseases: and the recently emerging problem of obesity, diabetes, and associated complications.&nbsp; Moreover, NIDDK-relevant pathogenic processes may contribute to HIV pathogenesis in other tissues and organ systems. For example, loss of intestinal epithelial barrier function associated with HIV-associated enteropathy may result in systemic inflammation that contributes to cardiovascular disease as well as comorbidities within NIDDK's mission, including obesity or liver disease. Mechanistic interrogation of the processes whereby HIV infection or its treatment contributes to these comorbidities and coinfections is needed to identify and develop strategies for preventing and alleviating these pathologies.</p>    <p>Tissues and processes within the scope of NIDDK's mission are also critical to other high priority HIV/AIDS research areas. &nbsp;These include the role of the male genital tract and gastrointestinal mucosa in HIV establishment, spread, and persistence; HIV-related gastrointestinal mucosal immune dysfunction; and other fundamental issues related to HIV prevention, cure, and treatment strategies.&nbsp; There is a great need to better understand these processes in both the male genital tract and the gastrointestinal mucosa to develop an effective cure for HIV as well as to effectively prevent transmission.&nbsp; Other tissues within NIDDK's interest, such as adipose tissue and kidneys, also serve as important viral reservoirs that need to be addressed for the development of a cure.</p>    <p><strong>Objectives and Scope</strong></p>    <p>This funding opportunity is intended to stimulate basic, translational, and clinical research within the mission of the NIDDK that addresses HIV/AIDS research topics identified as high priority by NIH.</p>    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.niddk.nih.gov/research-funding/research-programs"">Division of Digestive Diseases and Nutrition</a>&nbsp;seeks projects related to HIV infection or its treatment within its research mission, including studies on gastrointestinal immunity and inflammation, the gastrointestinal microbiome, HIV infection and persistence within the gastrointestinal tract, enteropathy, liver and biliary diseases, pancreatic diseases, nutrition, and obesity.</p>    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/offices-divisions/division-diabetes-endocrinology-metabolic-diseases/Pages/default.aspx"">Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases</a>&nbsp;seeks projects within its research mission, including studies examining the effects of HIV infection, including relevant host conditions, anti-retroviral therapy (ART), or other HIV-related therapies on metabolic/endocrine function and metabolic/endocrine-related outcomes (such as HIV- and ART-associated adipose tissue/lipodystrophic changes, as well as disorders of glucose metabolism and other HIV-associated metabolic and endocrine perturbations).</p>    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/offices-divisions/division-kidney-urologic-hematologic-diseases/Pages/default.aspx"">Division of Kidney, Urologic, and Hematologic Diseases</a>&nbsp;

In addition, cancer remains the leading cause of childhood disease-related mortality beyond the first year of life.</p>    <p>The genomics revolution holds promise for enabling the discovery of effective and targeted therapies based on the underlying genetic classification of conditions &ndash; the ideal of precision medicine.&nbsp; Developmental biology has revealed the underlying genetic networks common to organ system development, and the combined efforts of basic scientists studying these genetic networks and physician scientists sequencing patient cohorts together place the field of structural birth defects research on the verge of major advances.&nbsp; Likewise, major advances have been made in understanding the genetics and genomics of childhood cancers, particularly in the past decade through the work of large projects such as the NCI Childhood Cancer TARGET Initiative, the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital - Washington University Pediatric Cancer Genome Project, and other research efforts throughout the world. Within both research communities, understanding the etiology and mechanisms and ultimately formulating treatments and prevention strategies are more than ever a possibility for these pediatric conditions.</p>    <p>Heterogeneous genetic etiology is an issue for both the structural birth defects and the pediatric cancer fields.&nbsp; It is clear that recent advances in sequencing technology have led to greater insights.&nbsp; For example, our understanding of congenital heart defects has benefited with sequencing implicating de novo point mutations in several hundreds of genes that collectively contribute to approximately 10% of severe congenital heart disease cases.&nbsp; Importantly, a lesson from these and other studies is that large sample sizes are required to fully understand the heterogeneous genetic etiology.&nbsp; Studies have suggested that there may be genetic overlap between different, currently felt to be unrelated, birth defects.&nbsp; A lesson from these studies is that integrating genotype datasets from disparate diseases may increase the power for gene discovery and open up avenues of novel exploration.&nbsp; While these intellectual insights can be applied within the fields of structural birth defects research or childhood cancer research, it is equally true that genetic pathways common to both conditions will continue to be revealed by efforts that integrate genomic data.</p>    <p>In response to&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2019/text?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5b%22\%22hr2019\%22%22%5d%7d&amp;resultIndex=2"">The Gabriella Miller Kids First Act</a>, NIH, through the Common Fund, has established the&nbsp;<a href=""https://commonfund.nih.gov/KidsFirst"">Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program (Kids First)</a>.&nbsp; The Kids First Program's long term goal is to develop an integrated pediatric research data resource by obtaining and aggregating genome sequence and phenotype data for as many relevant structural birth defects and pediatric cancer cohorts as possible.&nbsp; It is anticipated that these genomic and phenotypic data will be of high value for the pediatric research community. During fiscal years 2015-2018, the intent is to augment the whole genome sequence data available to the research community by sequencing relevant cohorts through other funding opportunities (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-15-259.html"">PAR-15-259</a>;&nbsp;<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-16-150.html"">PAR-16-150</a>) and to establish a Kids First Sequencing Center(s) (<a href=""https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-16-001.html"">RFA-RM-16-001</a>).&nbsp; The Data Resource is expected to be funded in fiscal year 2017 and will coordinate access to Kids First data stored in NIH's&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/about.cgi"">dbGaP</a>&nbsp;and the NCI's&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/programs/gdc"">Genomic Data Commons (GDC)</a>.&nbsp; All told, the Kids First Program is expected to be a ten-year effort that will continue building an integrated data resource and expanding the capacity to effectively mine data across diverse conditions to uncover shared developmental pathways. The overall goal is to help researchers understand the underlying mechanisms of childhood diseases, leading to more refined diagnostic capabilities and ultimately more targeted therapies or interventions. &nbsp;</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Purpose</strong></div>    <p>The purpose of this FOA is to support meritorious small research projects that involve analyses of genomic and phenotypic datasets that are part of the Kids First Data Resource or that could be added to the Data Resource.&nbsp; Investigators who have had samples sequenced through the Kids First program may apply to analyze these datasets.&nbsp; Applicants whose analyses focus on their own whole genome sequence data must be willing and able to deposit their datasets into the Kids First Data Resource if funded, so that these data are available to the pediatric research community.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Scope</strong></div>    <p>The data analyses proposed should utilize the Kids First sequence and phenotype data currently available through the NIH's dbGaP or the NCI's GDC and eventually though the Kids First Data Resource.&nbsp; If the applicant already has other whole genome sequence data relevant to the Kids First program and is willing and able to submit it to the Kids First Data Resource, then they may also apply to this FOA for data analyses funds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both primary and secondary analyses of Kids First data may be proposed in order to develop hypotheses or investigate research questions related to structural birth defects and/or pediatric cancers.&nbsp; Studies proposed may combine data within cohorts or across phenotypically different cohorts to more powerfully address the research questions.&nbsp; While combining Kids First data and other genomic data in the analyses is permissible under this FOA, it is expected that the Kids First data will be the major focus of the project.

Current demographic trends show a considerable growth of the older segment of the United States population, aged 65 and over, with an estimated doubling from the present size of 43 million by 2050. Aging is the highest risk factor for the development of most common chronic illnesses and conditions &ndash; cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular, dental, oral and craniofacial diseases &ndash; and, as America grows older, we can expect a significant increase in the incidence of these age-related morbidities. To lessen the impact of this phenomenon on public health, it is imperative to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying aging and translate this knowledge into practice, to reduce the risk of and devise interventions for these conditions.</p>    <p>The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) generated resources to facilitate characterization of the human microbiota to further our understanding of how the microbiome impacts human health and disease. Recent research suggests that the microbiome may play a key role in the health and disease status of aging individuals. The human microbiome consists of hundreds of thousands of viruses, bacteria, protists and fungi which, together with the host cells, creates a unique ecosystem segregated by topography and function. Over millions of years of microbial-mammalian coevolution these systems have been shaped into an interdependent balance. Analyses of the bacterial species composition of gut microbiota from large healthy human young and adult cohorts representing different ages and dietary traditions have revealed broad interpersonal variability and significant intrapersonal oscillations over time. Built within this variability, however, is a relatively stable core repertoire of the microbial constituents that contribute to the host's physiological well-being. Analyses of human fecal microbiota show that disruption of the functional balance or dysbiosis, correlates with disease states for some conditions. Age-related dysbiosis has been linked to immunosenescence, chronic systemic inflammation, and the development of the frailty phenotype along with an increase in the incidence of chronic diseases. This may be a consequence of a dysfunctional relationship between the imbalanced microbiota and its metabolites with the host's immune system. One potential cause of dysbiosis, besides the physiological aging itself, is the use of medication, including antibiotics, which have been reported to reduce the diversity of the microbiota. Another cause may be the reduction or elimination of fiber-rich food, often a consequence of deteriorating dentition, salivary function, digestion and peristalsis. Assisted-living conditions have been shown to change the proportion of various microorganisms. Human observational studies have documented aging as a significant correlate of microbiome alteration with the fecal microbiota showing much greater interpersonal variability among individuals over 65 and differing considerably as a whole from the core repertoire and diversity levels of younger adults.</p>    <p>Clearly, additional research is needed to delineate more precisely how and why the microbiome changes during aging as well as how those changes affect an individual's health status, and thereby identify targets for interventions designed to promote healthier aging.</p>    <p><strong>Research Objectives</strong></p>    <p>Biological aging can be defined as the gradual deterioration of function at the physiological, organ or tissue level that involves many molecular and cellular mechanisms (genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, telomere attrition, loss of proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, altered intercellular communication and deregulated nutrient sensing) that also affect the risk of chronic diseases, including cancer. Among other factors, the process of aging can also be influenced by the microbiome. In-depth investigations on viral, and/or bacterial, and/or fungal interactions with the host could identify mechanisms that influence biological aging and the subsequent manifestation of multiple chronic conditions experienced in various racial/ethnic populations.</p>    <p>Investigators are encouraged to propose human prospective studies that identify objective biomarkers to assess the role of the microbiome as an environmental modifier of biological aging; analysis of clinical specimens; and animal models of the impact of age-related changes in the microbiome on risk and outcome of chronic diseases; interventions that modify the aged microbiome in the context of chronic diseases, including cancer.</p>    <p><strong><strong>Relevant studies include but are not limited to:</strong></strong></p>    <ol style=""font-weight: 400;"">    <ol style=""font-weight: 400;"">    <ul>    <li>How age-related changes&nbsp;in the microbiome (ex: aging of digestive system including the change in stomach pH, aging microbial biofilm, overgrowing Candida, exposure to heavy metals, chemical pollutants, etc.) may increase the inflammatory status and affect diseases risk and progression.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><em>Example:&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;Studies examining biologic signatures, including changes in microbiota pathobiont overgrowth and toxin production that can nurture a sort of pro-inflammatory loop and, in turn, worsen the health status of aged people.</p>    <ol style=""font-weight: 400;"">    <ol style=""font-weight: 400;"">    <ul>    <li>The mechanisms underlying senescence and the role of microbiota and microbially produced metabolites in the progress of aging and age-related diseases.</li>    </ul>    </ol>    </ol>    <p><em>Example:&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;Studies of symbiotic human microbiota or their metabolites and host neurogenic, immunologic, or metabolic pathways that suggest the potential for microbial-based therapeutic strategies that may aid&nbsp;in the modification of the human microbiome, for healthy aging;

BDS approaches can bring together data to evaluate the complex interplay between individual and contextual factors influencing the epidemiology of risk and care. Further, because this field is able to reveal unexpected correlations through analysis of diverse data, BDS approaches may reveal events that are rare, unseen in traditional datasets, and transient. Discovery and epidemiologic analysis of these events will considerably advance research on HIV networks of transmission and the care continuum.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Background</strong></div>    <p>New opportunities in science are emerging as large and complex data sets are becoming increasingly available to the research community. The NIH established the&nbsp;<a href=""https://commonfund.nih.gov/bd2k"">Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://datascience.nih.gov/"">Data Science</a>&nbsp;program to promote research and develop biomedical computing and informatics focused on important biomedical and behavioral problems. BDS specifically refers to research that capitalizes on the increased analytical speed, data storage capacity and liquidity of diverse data from health, genomics, community characteristics, environment, social media, and commercial activities. Thus, data in BDS are characterized by their high volume and variety, and the field is evolving to capture, manage, organize, harmonize, and analyze data to extract new knowledge.</p>    <p>Between 2011 and 2015, HIV incidence in the United States (U.S.) declined 15% among heterosexuals and 17% among injecting drug users. But new infections continue to increase in men of color who have sex with men and bisexuals. Over one million adults and adolescents in the U.S. are living with HIV, and nearly 15% of those are undiagnosed, risking their own health and increasing the risk of HIV transmission. Further challenging prevention efforts is the reality that HIV infection is concentrated in sub-populations at high risk. Traditional demographic and behavioral risk categories do not sufficiently delineate those at truly high risk. Prevention and HIV health care messaging that are directed at the broader demographic group may fail to reach high-risk sub-groups, stalling efforts to reduce the rate of HIV transmission in the U.S. The gaps in identifying those at greatest risk and vulnerability to HIV, points to a need for innovative strategies to improve HIV prevention efforts and the HIV care continuum.</p>    <p>NIH is interested in promoting and applying Big Data Science technologies, computing, informatics, and analytics to address gaps in our understanding of HIV transmission risks, social networks, and the HIV treatment continuum, including comorbidities such as cancer. NIH seeks to expand knowledge and provide insight into actionable approaches to improve HIV prevention and treatment. Big Data methods can provide insight into health behaviors in the context of an individual's life. However, along with the potential advances to be made with BDS research and discovery, there are also ethical considerations. Examples include issues of anonymity and the use of data, sometimes collected under conditions thought to be private or combined in ways unanticipated by the community. Yet because of its ability to elucidate associations not seen in less diverse data sets and the inherent scalability of BDS as compared to traditional study designs, these methods may promote the discovery of transformative approaches in HIV prevention, treatment, and long-term outcomes. BDS research may also be able to shed light on behaviors that occur outside of venues surveyed by health professionals or behaviors that are significantly modified by the presence of others and thus are difficult to document. Research that seeks to identify rare, unseen, perhaps transient events, networks, risk and health seeking behaviors as they pertain to HIV will fundamentally improve the quality of the inferences but may risk a loss of privacy or confidentiality. Accompanying this work, NIH expects the involvement of a bioethicist and development of an ethical framework where appropriate to guide HIV research in this rapidly expanding field.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Research Objectives</strong></div>    <p>This initiative is intended to promote collaborations among investigators with expertise in epidemiology, bioinformatics, mathematical modeling, statistics, social and behavioral sciences, HIV prevention and care, and bioethics, among others, to address&nbsp;<em>both</em>&nbsp;of the following objectives:</p>    <ol>    <ol>    <ul>    <li>Improve our understanding of HIV risk, health seeking behaviors, and the complex contextual environment in which they occur.&nbsp;</li>    <li>Develop and advance the ethical framework to evaluate Big Data methods in the constantly changing environment of available digital data.

Both licit and illicit drug use are preceded by identifiable bio-psycho-social and environmental factors that originate as early as the prenatal period. While initiation of licit and illicit drug use and misuse increases dramatically during the adolescent years, initiation and escalation can extend well beyond adolescence, and for some initiation begins in adulthood, including late adulthood. Drug use has many consequences beyond the potential for addiction and other problematic use. Drug use is associated with increased risk of HIV, viral hepatitis, and other infectious disease exposure and acquisition. Drug use also is associated with other comorbidities such as mental disorders as well as risky behaviors, such as violence, intentional self-harm, criminal activity, and impaired driving.&nbsp;With the current opioid epidemic drug use and misuse, specifically opioid misuse, is associated with opioid drug overdoses and death. &nbsp;</p>    <p>Alcohol is the most widely used psychoactive substance among U.S. adolescents and adults, and alcohol consumption is illegal only for a subgroup of the population (i.e., under-aged drinkers). Initiation of alcohol use can occur as early as pre-adolescence; the highest prevalence of alcohol use occurs in young adulthood. Early initiation of heavy drinking is associated with increased risk for developing an alcohol use disorder and is associated with traffic and other unintentional injuries, homicide, suicide, and poor academic performance.&nbsp;Many of the consequences of alcohol use depend on developmental timing and pattern of exposure or use. For example, alcohol use in women of childbearing age is associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in their offspring. In addition, developmental processes occurring in the brain during adolescence and the sensitivity of these processes to alcohol may be responsible for some of the long-term consequences of adolescent binge drinking. Alcohol use and abuse is one of the factors that thwarts efforts to prevent the spread of HIV infection in individuals who are at risk for acquisition.&nbsp; Alcohol use is associated with increased sexual and HIV risk behaviors and increased susceptibility to HIV acquisition. Alcohol use also interferes with HIV treatment among individuals living with HIV by increasing risk for HIV complications and negatively affecting medication adherence.&nbsp;Thus, prevention of alcohol use and abuse is important to controlling and preventing transmission of HIV and other infectious diseases.</p>    <p>Significant progress has been made in understanding effective approaches to the prevention of drug and alcohol use, misuse and related problems and alcohol and other substance use disorders over the past few decades, in part because of the careful attention given to understanding basic developmental processes involved in the initiation of drug and alcohol use, factors that increase vulnerability and also increase resiliency to substance use and substance use problems and the transition from use to problem use and disorder. However, challenges remain pertaining to adoption and implementation of effective prevention strategies and approaches in settings and systems, and further research is needed in this area. In addition, further research is needed to identify novel, highly effective prevention strategies for understudied groups and settings, including young adults and older adults, and populations and settings for which evidence based interventions do not exist. Further research also is needed to address emerging substance use issues. This FOA is issued during a time of rapid and significant policy shifts across the nation and during a time that the Nation is faced with an opioid epidemic and a resulting public health crisis. There is a need for innovative strategies, interventions, policies to prevent opioid and other prescription drug misuse, opioid use disorder and related problems across the lifespan, and specifically in populations and settings most impacted by the opioid crisis. The changing marijuana policy landscape and more permissive policies pertaining to medicinal, recreational and other use of marijuana continues to bring about new challenges for prevention efforts.&nbsp;NIDA is interested in research on prevention interventions and strategies that explicitly address shifts in recent and future marijuana policies. Both NIDA and NIAAA are interested in research on prevention strategies to address alcohol use in the context of these shifting policies, and alcohol use simultaneous with marijuana, prescription drug and opioid use, and illicit substances.</p>    <p>Continued transformations in the healthcare environment have resulted in uncertain but potentially new opportunities for increasing integration of prevention services, including greater attention to the prevention of licit and illicit drug and alcohol use, misuse and disorders and their potential value to mitigate many other negative outcomes. There is a need for research on opportunities, models and strategies for integrating and sustaining prevention interventions and services within healthcare settings. Both NIDA and NIAAA have an interest in feasibility and pilot studies that will contribute to expanding the knowledge base in these areas.</p>    <p>Targets for drug or alcohol prevention interventions can be classified according to level of risk: universal (targeted to whole populations, regardless of individual risk status), selective (targeted to individuals or subgroups with defined risk factors for substance use), indicated (targeted to individuals or sub-groups using/misusing substances but do yet meet disorder status), and tiered (targeted to two or more levels of prevention) (IOM, 2009). This FOA encourages prevention intervention research in all categories. In the alcohol field, universal alcohol prevention interventions are classified as 1)&nbsp;individually targeted behavioral interventions, and 2) environmental intervention strategies.&nbsp;NIAAA encourages research on both individual and environmental alcohol strategies (e.g., prevention intervention studies that incorporate both strategies to reduce risky and impaired driving).</p>    <p>Successful drug and alcohol prevention and HIV prevention programs have utilized a number of theoretical perspectives for predicting differential drug and alcohol use trajectories and elucidating developmentally grounded mediators, or risk and protective factors amenable to change. Continued progress in prevention research relies on a strong understanding and refinement of successful theories and their application.&nbsp;This FOA encourages research that focuses on improving and refining existing theories within a prevention intervention context as well as developing and testing new theoretical models for prevention and approaches informed by basic and behavioral research findings from diverse disciplines. Successful alcohol and drug prevention programs have targeted and been delivered in varied contexts, such as schools, healthcare, tribal, and justice settings, neighborhoods, communities, community service organizations, workplaces, and businesses. This FOA seeks research efforts to develop and test new contexts, modalities and methods for intervention delivery, as new contexts and modalities for access and use of alcohol and drugs become evident (e.g., social media, changing marijuana polices), new technologies for intervention delivery develop (e.g., eHealth, mobile technologies, social media), and new service delivery settings and processes emerge.</p>    <p>To advance the field, novel prevention interventions must build on findings from basic science and other diverse disciplines. Opportunities exist to incorporate neurobiological, genetic and physiological measures to better understand the impact of prevention interventions on individual functioning across the course of development. This FOA encourages prevention research that builds on findings from etiology and epidemiology research and other fields, including human development, neuroscience, psychology, sociology, communications, technology, economics, systems science and other fields.</p>    <p>Investigators are strongly encouraged to integrate the perspectives of end users, such as prevention practitioners, implementers, funders, organizations and systems meaningfully into the research process from its inception, to ensure that prevention interventions and practices meet real-world end user needs and realities and to foster implementability and sustainability. NIDA strongly encourages investigators to identify likely end users of prevention interventions (e.g., public or private organizations or systems), create partnerships at relevant stages of the research, and include letters indicating support for the project and the interventions/strategies to be developed/tested, explaining level of involvement of partners, and, when appropriate, plans or commitment for using the findings or products, and plans or commitment to implement the intervention/strategies if the outcomes are favorable.</p>    <p><strong>Specific Areas of Research Interest</strong></p>    <p>This FOA provides support for testing and evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of novel approaches to improving drug and alcohol prevention interventions, obtaining estimates of and testing strategies for improving participation and retention, designing and testing prevention relevant measures, and obtaining preliminary data needed as a pre-requisite to a larger-scale (efficacy, effectiveness, implementation) prevention intervention or prevention services study. The following sections describe examples of prevention research areas of specific interest to NIDA and NIAAA.&nbsp;This FOA encourages, but is not meant to be limited to research applications in the research areas identified below.&nbsp; Potential applicants are strongly encouraged to contact NIDA and NIAAA Scientific/Research staff to discuss possible research concepts prior to submitting an application (see Section VII below).</p>    <p><em>A. Pilot and Feasibility Testing of New, Revised, or Adapted Interventions</em></p>    <p>This FOA is appropriate for pilot testing of new, revised, or adapted prevention interventions targeting drug or alcohol use, misuse or abuse and drug- and alcohol-related risk behaviors. This FOA encourages pilot and feasibility research on the following and related topics:</p>    <p>Feasibility and pilot testing of screening and universal brief intervention models to prevent alcohol and drug use and misuse (including opioid misuse and opioid use disorder) for delivery in medical settings and the broader healthcare system (e.g., primary care, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, adolescent medicine, pain and rehabilitation settings, and emergency departments).</p>    <p>Development and pilot testing of novel drug and alcohol use prevention interventions for delivery in healthcare settings, particularly settings that serve persons at high risk for substance use problems.</p>    <p>(including prescription drug and opioid misuse and opioid use disorder), such as pain and rehabilitation clinics, emergency departments, community behavioral healthcare facilities.</p>    <p>Development and pilot testing of innovative strategies, approaches, policies to prevent opioid and other prescription drug misuse and opioid use disorder and related problems for populations across the lifespan and in settings most impacted by the opioid crisis.</p>    <p>Studies that test strategies for prevention of opioid misuse and opioid use disorders in the context of medical treatment for and management of pain.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Preliminary studies that include measurement of suicide ideation and behaviors in substance use prevention efforts to help add to understanding how and why these approaches might mitigate suicide morbidity and mortality.</p>    <p>Development and pilot testing of environmental and community intervention strategies within and across health, justice, education, community and social service settings, where the benefits of multi-level strategies to prevent substance use/misuse and abuse (including opioid misuse and opioid use disorder), HIV infection, and related morbidity and high-risk behaviors could be explored.</p>    <p>Translation of findings from neuroscience, basic behavioral and social sciences and other disciplines to develop, improve and pilot test prevention messaging content and delivery strategies</p>    <p>Translation of research findings from epidemiology, cognitive science, neuroscience, genetics and other sciences to develop and pilot test novel prevention interventions, better understand mechanisms of intervention effects, and inform tailoring and optimizing of prevention interventions, including for vulnerable and understudied populations.</p>    <p>Studies of interventions to reduce high intensity drinking, simultaneous alcohol and drug use, drug and alcohol use related intentional and unintentional injuries, accidents, motor vehicle crashes, opioid overdoses and violence, including suicide, interpersonal violence, and community violence, as well as studies of interventions focused on college age (including those not in college) and underage populations.</p>    <p>Studies that evaluate application of new HIV prevention modalities (e.g. novel biomedical approaches, such as PrEP, PEP, home testing) in drug and alcohol using populations.</p>    <p>Studies that test integrated drug, alcohol, HIV, and related morbidities prevention and treatment strategies in a variety of healthcare, social service and educational settings.</p>    <p>Studies that evaluate the application of new technologies and modalities for delivering, implementing and testing prevention interventions, particularly for difficult to reach populations and settings (including at-risk and stigmatized populations, rural settings).</p>    <p><em>B. Feasibility Testing for Prevention Services Research</em></p>    <p>The prevention field has made significant progress leading to the identification of effective approaches and strategies to prevent substance use and substance use disorders, but challenges remain for adoption and implementation in settings and systems. An important emphasis of NIDA&rsquo;s and NIAAA's prevention research programs is prevention services research, which includes questions pertaining to system- and organizational-level processes and mechanisms associated with the uptake, selection, adoption, adaptation, implementation, sustainability, and financing of empirically validated prevention interventions in community, practice and service systems. This FOA encourages pilot studies to empirically validate the feasibility of intervention and implementation protocols, implementation and fidelity measures and monitoring systems, training and implementation methodologies, and other feasibility research needed in preparation for large scale prevention services research.&nbsp;</p>    <p><em>This FOA encourages feasibility research on the following and related topics:</em></p>    <p>Evaluating the feasibility of integrating and sustaining novel drug and alcohol prevention interventions and strategies into pre-existing infrastructures and systems such as state-level prevention and treatment systems; medical settings (e.g., primary healthcare, pain and rehabilitation clinics, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, adolescent medicine, HIV/STI clinics, AIDS service organizations, emergency departments); and other service systems, particularly where high risk populations are found (e.g., child welfare, foster care, justice).</p>    <p>Developing and testing the feasibility of strategies and models for integration and implementation of sustainable evidence-based prevention interventions and approaches into healthcare and other community, practice and service systems (e.g., justice, child welfare, schools, workplaces, military).</p>    <p>Pilot and feasibility testing of innovative strategies and models for optimizing key implementation processes: adaptation and customization processes, implementation fidelity, sustainability, training and retaining prevention workforce personnel (e.g., prevention practitioners, intervention implementers).</p>    <p>Evaluating feasibility and acceptability of strategies for integrating screening and combined biomedical and behavioral strategies for HIV prevention in populations where suicide risk, alcohol and drug use risk and detection and referral strategies may already occur.</p>    <p>Pilot and feasibility testing of innovative technology and communication strategies and platforms (e.g., eHealth, electronic medical record systems, mobile and portable devices, social media) for delivering efficacious prevention interventions in healthcare and other settings and infrastructures.</p>    <p>Reference</p>    <p>National Research Council and Institute of Medicine.

High resolution and quantitative tools are needed to enhance the precision of diagnostic approaches for oral pathologies to guide options for treatment. This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to encourage early stage research projects that develop, adapt, optimize, and validate imaging-based applications and data analysis tools to enhance oral disease detection, diagnosis, and treatment. The long-term goal is to facilitate translation of research findings into clinical practice, paving the way for personalized health care through objective measures that promote accurate and timely diagnosis, targeted therapies, and improved patient survival and quality of life.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p>This FOA will utilize the R21 exploratory/developmental grant to support investigation of novel scientific ideas or new model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical research.

They include frictional and ulcerative lesions, bacterial and fungal infections, complications of local and systemic conditions, and malignancies. In current clinical practice, differential diagnosis is based on oral examination that includes visual inspection and palpation; however, subtle lesions can pass undetected.&nbsp; Although some innocuous lesions may be readily diagnosed based on their clinical presentation alone, others are not as easily differentiated.&nbsp; It is difficult to distinguish among benign, premalignant, and malignant lesions because many mucosal conditions have a similar appearance. For example, oral cancer may present initially as a small white or red lesion, but diagnosis is often delayed until the lesion becomes unresolved. As a result, oral cancer has one of the lowest five-year survival rates (50% or less) among the major cancer types.&nbsp; Furthermore, dysplasia or micro-invasive carcinoma can be difficult to detect because they can be present in clinically normal-appearing mucosa.</p>    <p>Successful therapeutic management of oral mucosal lesions depends on a definitive, accurate, and timely diagnosis.&nbsp; Despite general accessibility of the mouth during physical examination, oral lesions are often not diagnosed until late stages of disease.&nbsp; Histological analysis of biopsy samples is the gold standard technique for diagnosis of lesions that cannot be differentiated based on clinical appearance alone. The standard approach relies on gross microscopic assessment of atypia that may not always reflect the underlying pathology or disease condition. Histopathological analyses are often complicated by low specificity and sensitivity, in addition to high intra- and inter- observer variability due to reliance on subjective and non-quantitative measures.&nbsp; Results may be further complicated by the quality of the biospecimens and inconsistency in sample preparation.&nbsp; The use of highly subjective measures to diagnose oral lesions can be dangerous because serious conditions, such as oral manifestations and complications of uncontrolled systemic diseases and cancers, may be overlooked.&nbsp; The lack of effective diagnostic and quantitative methods that can replace or complement conventional histopathology has clearly limited the ability of clinicians to consistently and accurately categorize oral pathologies.&nbsp; As a result, treating pathological conditions of the oral cavity is often challenging.&nbsp; New and improved methods are required to detect and analyze early mucosal changes to optimize treatment planning and reduce morbidity and mortality.</p>    <div class=""heading4""><strong>Specific Objectives Of This FOA&nbsp;</strong></div>    <p>The specific scope of this Funding of Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to address challenges of detection, diagnosis and treatment of lesions in the oral cavity and oropharynx. The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) recognizes the unmet need for more sensitive and quantitative tools for management of oral diseases. A few simple techniques for detecting precancerous and early malignant lesions have been developed over the years to supplement oral examination. However, the utility of these methods is still limited due to their low specificity (e.g., fluorescence, toluidine stain) and high false-negative rate (e.g., brush biopsy for cytology).&nbsp;&nbsp; Considerable progress has been made in precision imaging technologies and methods for the acquisition of anatomical, functional, and molecular imaging data.&nbsp; Improvements in tools for data analyses, display methods, and reporting structures would enable quantification of physiological structures and biological functions for monitoring dynamic biological processes at the cellular and subcellular scales. This FOA will support research that applies these technological advances to improve diagnosis of oral diseases and lead to more precise, personalized treatment.</p>    <p>This FOA invites applications that propose to adapt, optimize, and validate existing imaging systems or develop new image-based methodologies and analytic tools capable of improving early detection, diagnosis, and targeted treatment of oral diseases and conditions.&nbsp; Studies may include single or multi-modality in vivo imaging and spectroscopy systems, image-guided intervention and drug delivery systems, image analysis, and molecular imaging probe design and development.&nbsp;&nbsp;

One of the key elements of the M&amp;E process involves &ldquo;<em>supportive supervision</em><a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</a>&rdquo;, linked performance monitoring which is implemented jointly by the MOH and the Municipality Health Sector. The supportive supervision is aligned to monitor primarily inputs availability for delivering the Primary Health Care (PHC) services. The performance monitoring process implementation across all the PHC facilities was initiated in 2014. The Joint Annual Health Sector Review 2014 (JHSR) report<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"">[2]</a> states that &ldquo;supportive supervision&rdquo; is a &ldquo;continuous process&rdquo; to improve the readiness of facilities to deliver the Basic Services Package (BSP).</p>    <p>The performance monitoring of health facilities using the supportive supervision tool is implemented in an integrated way, and considers assessment of facility readiness once in every quarter in every primary health care facility. The Health Posts &ldquo;supportive supervision&rdquo; assessment tool covers 10 domains which include human resources, buildings and its condition, electricity, toilet, furniture, equipment, lab test, behavioral change communication material, other programs, drugs and skills of staff on duty. The hospital and Community Health Centers (CHC) assessment tool has 20 domains each. The use of a standardized check list<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</a> and scoring system allows the process to measure performance against common benchmarks and measure progress over time. In addition, the findings of &ldquo;supportive supervision&rdquo; exercises feed into municipality/district level periodic performance reviews for the improvement of the planning processes and improvement actions are grouped into the following:</p>    <ol>    <li>immediate actions that the facilities can implement without additional resources,</li>    <li>the medium term actions that the facility can implement with some support from the municipality/district level, and</li>    <li>Longer term actions that require the intervention to be put in government&rsquo;s annual budget for the following year.</li>    </ol>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>The JHSR 2014 revealed that Ermera was the only municipality which conducted all four rounds of supportive supervision successfully, and used the findings for performance improvement. In that Municipality, the performance score of Community Health Centers (CHCs) was 69% (against a benchmark of 80%) in the first quarter) and it increased to 83% in (the fourth quarter). The Health Posts (HP) had lower score of 34% (in first quarter) and it increased to 60% (in the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</a>). This shows that effective implementation of the performance monitoring, improvement planning and implementation has a huge potential to improve facility performance.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>The JHSR of 2014 recommended to &ldquo;reinforce supportive supervision and monitoring systems to track&nbsp;progress and take corrective actions&rdquo; and &ldquo;to enhance municipality level accountability for performance&rdquo;. During the implementation process, need to include monitoring of management functions and services delivery functions were identified. In addition, with the launching of the Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) Guideline in 2015, there is a need to tailor the tools to the new guidelines was also identified. With the decentralization initiative launched by the government, it is responsible of each municipalities to do their own planning, implementation and monitoring. Thus, it has further become more important for the Ministry of Health to set performance standards and monitor them regularly. Therefore, the MoH intends to revise/update the existing supportive supervision guideline, tools and process and is seeking technical assistance of performance monitoring expert for this work.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1""></a></p>; <p><strong>Opportunity Structure</strong></p>    <p>Purpose of Consultancy</p>    <p>&ldquo;The assignment broadly covers: a) review of the Ministry of Health&rsquo;s facility performance assessment approach using supportive supervision, the implementation process, best practices and limitations; b) identification of areas for improvement bringing in global best practices and changed local context to make it suitable for the context and current need of the health sector; and c) to develop updated facility assessment guidelines, process, tools and training materials to enhance implementation capacity.</p>"257879,Tender,"Promote Favourable Social Norms And Attitudes To Promote Gender Equality And Prevent Discrimination Of And Violence Against Women; ; <p><strong>Objective of the Support</strong></p>    <p>The project will contribute to the achievement of the programme &ldquo;Ending violence against women and girls: Implementing norms, changing minds&rdquo; (February 2017- December 2019) which aims at ending gender-based discrimination and VAWG, with a particular focus on the most disadvantaged groups of women, in six Western Balkans countries and Turkey. The programme is anchored in the normative frameworks of CEDAW and the Istanbul Convention, and is also in alignment with EU accession standards.&nbsp; The programme is funded by the European Union within the Instrument for Pre- Accession Assistance (IPA) II. More specifically, the project will contribute to the programme Specific Objective 2: &ldquo;<em>To promote favourable social norms and attitudes to promote gender equality and prevent discrimination of and violence against women</em>.&rdquo;</p>    <p>Different studies analyzing the way masculinities are perceived in BiH have shown that exposure to domestic violence, the media, and feeling of social isolation and inadequacy are linked with boys and their use of violence. They also found that men and boys identify a crisis of masculinity with the loss of status due to unemployment and lack of means to provide for the family, driving feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem, as well as the expectations of masculine behaviour and peer pressure. Other findings indicate men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s stereotypical attitudes towards gender equality and VAWG and what it means to be a man and what means to be a woman. The fact that men and women, boys and girls, condone violence as socially acceptable behavior is alarming and requires a more concerted effort to achieve a change in attitude.</p>    <p>To this end, the approach towards behavioral change is planned to include innovative solutions in line with a regional methodology called the Gender Action Lab (Gender Lab) as a space for generation of new ideas in fighting gender stereotypes, using new tools that incorporate interpersonal communication, community mobilization, media and policy advocacy. The Gender Lab will eventually bring about its own methods and approach to social innovation in each of the participating countries - defined as the framework to increase the adoption of evidence-based practices among professionals and institutions, and as a core skill for public sector workers, including communication and advocacy professionals. The Gender Lab will be a regionally-driven approach further designed and tested at the country level.</p>    <p><strong>Scope of the Project</strong></p>    <p>The programme builds on the strong links of UN Women and the EU with women&rsquo;s civil society organizations (CSOs) in the region, placing the programme in a strategic position to assist women in their drive for rights as citizens. CSOs, in particular women's organizations, play a crucial role in the promotion of gender equality and women's rights. They are key advocacy stakeholders in terms of moving governments from commitment to implementation in relation to international normative standards. They are also key stakeholders in the provision of services that are essential in the establishment of multi-sectoral and coordinated mechanisms to adequately respond to the needs of survivors of violence. Furthermore, women's organizations are key stakeholders in ensuring that the perspectives and voices of the most excluded and discriminated-against groups of women are heard by policy makers. Additionally, women's organizations are instrumental - in terms of their networks, outreach and innovation - to facilitating the required behavioural and attitudinal changes for tackling the structural barriers to gender equality and ending VAWG.</p>    <p>UN Women Country Office in BiH is seeking to engage women&rsquo;s CSOs/ women&rsquo;s CSO networks and platforms of women belonging to disadvantaged groups and/or organizations working on women&rsquo;s rights issues that will contribute to achieving the following result:</p>    <p>Women, girls, men and boys at community and individual level have a better understanding and acceptance of gender equality.</p>    <p>CSOs with expertise and proven experience in prevention of VAWG and domestic violence, are invited to submit proposals, individually or jointly with other organizations, to design and implement a project that will incorporate the idea of the gender innovation facility and showcase its replication potentials. Implementing partners are invited to submit their proposals targeting any of the levels of government in BiH, with the main focus on entity, cantonal/regional and local level.</p>;"257907,Tender,"Rapid Assessment and Implementation of Short and Long-Term Transformation of the Central Medical Store; ; <p><strong>PURPOSE STATEMENT</strong></p>    <p>The purpose of this RFP is for the Global Fund, in collaboration with CECOMA, to identify a team of consultants which will be required to undertake a rapid assessment of the CMS organisational structure, operational processes, identify warehouse improvement opportunities and develop both short and long-term transformation strategies.

There will be 6 campaigns each year. Please refer to Article 13 of the special conditions.</p>    <p><br /><strong>Selection and award criteria</strong></p>    <p>Selection criteria:The following selection criteria will be applied to tenderers. In the case of tenders submitted by a consortium, these selection criteria will be applied to the consortium as a whole unless specified otherwise. The selection criteria will not be applied to natural persons and single-member companies when they are subcontractors:<br />1) Economic and financial capacity of tenderer (based on i.a. item 3 of the tender form for a supply contract). In the case of the tenderer being a public body, equivalent information should be provided. The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last 3 years for which accounts have been closed:<br />&bull; the average annual turnover of the tenderer must exceed 3 500 000 EUR.<br />2) Professional capacity of tenderer (based on i.a. items 4 and 5 of the tender form for a supply contract). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last 3 years from the submission deadline:<br />&bull; at least 6 staff currently work for the tenderer in fields related to this contract.<br />3) Technical capacity of tenderer (based on i.a. items 5 and 6 of the tender form for a supply contract). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last 5 years from the submission deadline:<br />&bull; the tenderer has delivered supplies under at least 1 contract with a budget of at least 5 000 000 EUR in the field relating to the supply of vaccine baits which was implemented during the following period: 5 years from the submission deadline.<br />This means that the contract the tenderer refers to could have been started or completed at any time during the indicated period but it does not necessarily have to be started and completed during that period, nor implemented during the entire period. Tenderers are allowed to refer either to projects completed within the reference period (although started earlier) or to projects not yet completed. In the first case the project will be considered in its whole if proper evidence of performance is provided (statement or certificate from the entity which awarded the contract, final acceptance). In case of projects still ongoing only the portion satisfactorily completed during the reference period will be taken into consideration. This portion will have to be supported by documentary evidence (similarly to projects completed) also detailing its value.&nbsp;<br />Capacity-providing entities:<br />An economic operator may, where appropriate and for a particular contract, rely on the capacities of other entities, regardless of the legal nature of the links which it has with them. Some examples of when it may not be considered appropriate by the contracting authority are when the tenderers rely in majority on the capacities of other entities or when they rely on key criteria. If the tenderer relies on other entities it must prove to the contracting authority that it will have at its disposal the resources necessary for performance of the contract, for example by producing a commitment on the part of those entities to place those resources at its disposal. Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility and notably that of nationality, as the economic operator. Furthermore, the data for this third entity for the relevant selection criterion should be included in the tender in a separate document. Proof of the capacity will also have to be furnished when requested by the contracting authority.&nbsp;<br />With regard to technical and professional criteria, a tenderer may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the tasks for which these capacities are required.<br />With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies, become jointly and severally liable for the performance of the contract.</p>    <p>Award criteria:Price.</p>    <p><br /><strong>Tendering</strong></p>    <p>How to obtain the tender dossier:The tender dossier is available from the following Internet address:&nbsp;https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/europeaid/online-services/index.cfm?do=publi.welcome&nbsp;and&nbsp;https://www.cfcu.gov.tr</p>    <p>The tender dossier is also available from the contracting authority.

Improving quality of care in health facilities has become increasingly important to improve birth outcomes, accelerate reduction in intrapartum-related deaths, and stimulate demand for institutional births. The partograph is currently the main tool used to support decision-making of health professionals during labour and childbirth. However, the use of partograph in labour wards is relatively low and various limitations that have also been identified when the partograph is used call for a new tool. In addition, WHO is developing new guidelines for intrapartum care.</p>    <p>The main goal of this activity is to develop a simplified, effective, labour monitoring-to-action (SELMA) tool. A prospective cohort study was conducted in 13 health facilities in Nigeria and Uganda. A total of 9995 women participated in this study. Statistical and computational analysis were carried out to identify essential elements of intrapartum monitoring that trigger the decision to use interventions aimed at preventing poor labour outcomes, develop a simplified, monitoring-to-action algorithm for labour management.

This review aims to develop and consider strategic and managerial options more than evaluating operational details and not to develop a new approach to malaria elimination in this region.</p>    <p>Key evaluation questions<br />The overall questions are: What lessons can we learn from malaria elimination efforts undertaken so far in southern Africa &ndash; what should continue and what should be done differently? How can the Global Fund best support malaria elimination in southern Africa?</p>    <p>More specifically:<br />1. What are possible strategic options for the Global Fund to address malaria eliminations in southern Africa, especially using the US$20 million Catalytic Investment? What are key components/activities that strengthen and/or complement national malaria programs toward achieving malaria elimination in the region?<br />2. To what extent are the two PRs implementing the agreed activities and achieving progress toward the agreed objectives? Are these activities and outputs of the programs consistent with the intended impacts toward regional malaria elimination?<br />3. How well are the two PRs positioned to implement activities that enable regional malaria elimination? What are the strengths and bottlenecks for each type of activity? Did they implement activities on time? How can the implementation be improved? What may be alternative arrangements to avoid bottlenecks? Are the two grants complementary to each other? Is the cost of having two parallel regional mechanisms and grants well justified?<br />4. What changes have been introduced by the implementation of the two regional grants? How can positive changes be further strengthened? How can negative changes be rectified and minimized in future?<br />5. How have synergies and complementarities with national malaria programs, other donors and key actors been ensured? How have redundancies and duplication of efforts minimized, and efficiency ensured? How can regional coordination be improved? To what degree are the Regional Coordinating Mechanisms contributing to maximizing the effectiveness of the regional grants? How might their performance and accountability be improved?</p>    <p>Consultations should include regional and national coordinating mechanisms, PRs, national programs, WHO, key partners such as BMGF, PMI, experts, civil society and affected communities, the Global Fund and other relevant stakeholders. It is expected to show separate findings and conclusions for MOSASWA and E8, and for general malaria elimination issues if relevant. Recommendations should be realistically implementable and their implementation amenable to oversight by the Global Fund. They should be technically feasible but also have potential to gain political, as well as potentially financial, supports from partners, and be within the available envelop for a three year grant.</p>    <p>Although conclusions and recommendations from this review might possibly have some implications for country malaria grants, this is not the main purpose as there are other processes for managing and assessing the country malaria grants and they are progressing. Similarly, evaluation of performance of country malaria grants in the eight countries is not in the scope of this review, which focuses on regional malaria elimination, though related documents may be reviewed to inform this exercise.</p>"263779,Tender,"Technical Assistance for Improving the Blood Transfusion Management System in Turkey (GPN); ; <p><strong style=""font-size: 11px;"">Technical assistance for improving the blood transfusion management system in Turkey</strong><br /><strong style=""font-size: 11px;"">2017/S 179-365742</strong><br /><strong style=""font-size: 11px;"">Service prior information notice</strong><br /><strong style=""font-size: 11px;"">Location &mdash; Europe (non-EU)/Turkey</strong></p>    <p>1.Publication reference: EuropeAid/139230/IH/SER/TR.</p>    <p>2.Procedure: Restricted.</p>    <p>3.Programme title: Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA II).</p>    <p>4.Financing: IPA budget item 22.02.03.02 of the general budget of the EU (85 %) and national contribution (15 %).</p>    <p>5.Contracting authority: Directorate of European Union and Financial Assistance (DEUFA) in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security of the Republic of Turkey, Ankara, TURKEY.</p>    <p>6.Nature of contract: Fee-based.</p>    <p>7.Contract description: The purpose of this contract is to support the blood transfusion management system in Turkey with a focus on quality, self-sufficiency and appropriate clinical use of blood and blood components by carrying out activities such as trainings, meetings, workshops; providing support to the preparation of guidelines, improving IT systems, conducting awareness-raising activities and scientific and technical studies regarding blood transfusion management.</p>    <p>8.Indicative budget: 5 157 139,68 EUR.</p>    <p>9.Intended timing of publication of the contract notice: November 2017.</p>    <p>10.Additional information: Not applicable.</p>    <p>11.Legal basis: Regulation (EU) No 231/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11.3.2014 establishing an Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA II) (OJ L 77, 15.3.2014, p. 11).</p>    <p><strong><span style=""font-size: 11px;"">Remarks:</span></strong><br /><span style=""font-size: 11px;"">There must be a minimum period of 30 calendar days between the publication of this prior information notice and the publication of the corresponding contract notice.</span></p>    <p>No applications or requests for information should be sent at this stage.</p>;"264035,Tender,"Supporting the Medical Education Reform (MER); ; <h2>1.

Regarding health services delivery, the MoH is responsible for the operations of the regional referral hospitals. These however do not operate under a meaningful regional governance structure and have no policy structure needed to support health service delivery at the local government.</p>    <p>The Local Governments (LGs)s are legally responsible for district level planning, budgeting and resource appropriation, personnel management, and supervision of service delivery through their district health offices, the chief administrative officer and the political oversight arms of the councils, all this with limited direct engagement with the MoH. Despite this, most budgetary decisions are made at the national level because the districts heavily depend on the central government financial transfers. The central government has taken some measures to strengthen vertical accountability, but local stakeholders claim that those measures rather limit their decision making space to improve services at the local level.</p>    <p>The decentralization reform was intended to improve local ownership, but has resulted in deep rooted disconnect between central and local levels, a problem compounded by limited technical capacity, poor planning and coordination between the local and central government entities, which has prevented the smooth functioning of the institutional framework for health services.</p>    <p>Several government-led and donor supported interventions at both national and subnational level have spurred some improvements in the health system like increased human resources, improved theatre operations, improved facility infrastructure directly impacted on health outcomes (including reduction in maternal and child mortality and morbidity, reduction in HIV prevalence to mention but a few); however, the magnitude of improvements have been minimal owing to recurrent systems challenges in the health sector. The GoU offers free healthcare for all in the public sector, however this policy is undermined by various health systems challenges including poor governance, insufficient financing, inadequate human resources for health (HRH), poor data use for planning and decision-making, and an over-reliance on external donor support for financing basic health service delivery. Overall, Uganda&rsquo;s health system is inherently weak, fragmented and poorly funded at all levels.</p>    <p>The GoU through its Vision 2040 seeks to adopt a new paradigm, moving focus from majorly facility-based to household-based disease prevention and health delivery system. The GoU seeks to empower households and communities to take greater control of their health by promoting healthy practices and lifestyles. This vision is responsive to the looming demographic challenges that are driven by a high population growth rate and existing socio-economic disparities that increase the burden on an already weakened health system.</p>    <p><strong>USAID perspective and priorities for Uganda's health system </strong></p>    <p>USAID/Uganda has conducted a series of evaluations, assessments, portfolio reviews, and learning visits related to activities implemented under the previous Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS 1.0). Notable lessons from the numerous reviews point to the fact that weak systems continue to be one of the main impediments to Uganda&rsquo;s development. There is growing recognition that progress under targeted health interventions will not be sustained in the long-term if concurrent investments are not made to strengthen the health system; that fostering transformational leadership in the health systems is instrumental to achieving accountability, responsiveness and improved development outcomes in health; and that the systematic application of a thoughtful and deliberate Collaboration, Learning and Adapting (CLA) approach to programs achieves better results especially if the learning curve is short and allows time for implementation of adapted ideas.</p>    <p>In its new iteration of the CDCS 2.0, USAID/Uganda identified &ldquo;unaccountable and unresponsive systems&rdquo; as one of the three challenges threatening to jeopardize the pathway to inclusive and sustainable development in Uganda. In order to overcome this, USAID/Uganda seeks to support key country systems to become more responsive to Uganda&rsquo;s development needs. CDCS 2.0 defines country systems as: 1) those interconnected sets of actors (governments, civil society, private sector, universities, individual citizens and others) who influence a development outcome for Uganda; 2) the rules (formal and informal) that guide their actions; 3) how they interact with each other, including incentive structures and power dynamics; and, 4) the resources they can access (the mechanism they deploy the resources) to achieve a positive development outcome. The health system is one of the priority country systems selected to be strengthened over the life of the strategy. Addressing leadership and governance challenges, domestic financing and improving management of key health resources, and strengthening community systems are therefore central to strengthening the health system to provide quality services in Uganda.&nbsp;</p>; <p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>    <p>The purpose of the Uganda Health Systems Strengthening (UHSS) activity is to strengthen the health system through improving leadership and accountability for results in public and private health sectors at both national and local levels. The activity seeks to strengthen central level stewardship and district level management of the health system; support initiatives that increase domestic financing for health; identify and implement interventions that increase efficient use of key health resources; and strengthen state and non-state community systems for improved quality health services.</p>    <p><strong>Scope</strong></p>    <p>The UHSS activity will focus on systems strengthening interventions at the national level focusing on key government and non-government institutions and actors, and at the subnational level focusing on regional, district and local government structures, all of which impact quality of health service delivery at the health facility and community level. The activity will predominantly work with targeted health sector institutions in the Ministry of Health such as planning department, community health department, human resource department, regional referral hospitals including their governance structures, district health teams and health facility management and staff, as well as the Private for profit (PFP) and Private not for profit (PNFP) health sector governance and other key organizations in the health system. The activity will also work with the Ministry of Gender particularly with the corresponding community development offices at the subnational level in aspects of community systems strengthening that are relevant for and influence health service delivery. In addition, UHSS will interface with selected institutions and individuals from outside the health and social sector that influence the performance of the health system, including but not limited to: the Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development (MoFPED); the Ministry of Local Government; the National Planning Commission; the Office of the Prime Minister's Delivery and coordination Units; the National Parliamentary Committee on Health; Civil Society Organizations; district councils and chairpersons; and individual public and private sector leaders as part of strategic partnership. The UHSS activity will target individuals, groups, and organizations involved in health policy making, planning, program implementation and oversight at national, regional, district, facility and community levels. These include MOH technical and managerial staffs, political appointees and elected officials, private sector leaders, citizen groups and emerging leaders among women, men and youth, and community and religious leaders.</p>    <p>The first sub-purpose for the UHSS activity will support interventions to improve leadership and accountability for results. Achievement of key results will require strengthening of leadership and management capacity of national and subnational key actors in both the public and private health sector; supporting improvements in transparency and accountability particularly at the national and subnational level; supporting efforts to institutionalize management for results and support enabling environments through development of key health systems policies, quality standards and regulations that are central to this activity.</p>    <p>The second sub-purpose for this activity will support national and subnational efforts to increase domestic financing for health and efficient use of key financial and non-financial health resources. The activity will focus on supporting the use of evidence based advocacy for increasing the health sector budget, support budget preparation, management and execution in the health sector; explore and implement innovative health financing options at national, district, and regional referral hospital levels; and identify and work with GoU to implement interventions that improve efficient management of both human and financial resources.</p>    <p>The third sub-purpose of the UHSS activity will strengthen targeted community systems critical for quality health services delivery through: supporting at national level the development of a regulatory and operating framework for community health systems ; support capacity building interventions for key community health workforce including but not limited to the Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) of the MoH; and engagement of community actors to improve accountability, performance and management of health services.</p>    <p>Given that this is a systems strengthening activity, how the support is provided matters; this activity requires high levels of innovation and a creative approach to building partnership with key stakeholders both in government and non-government, while at the same time aiming to build capabilities for these services to be provided locally in a sustainable manner.</p>"267846,Tender,"Supply and Installation of Medical Equipment, ICT Equipment and Various Consumables; ; <p><strong>INVITATION FOR BIDS</strong></p>    <p><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH &amp; SANITATION</strong><br /><strong>INTEGRATED HEALTH PROJECTS ADMINIDTRATION UNIT</strong><br /><strong>SIERRA LEONE</strong><br /><strong>NAME OF PROJECT:</strong><em><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.1pt;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></em><strong>HEALTH SERVICE DELIVERY &amp; SYSTEMS SUPPORT</strong><br /><strong>CREDIT No.:&nbsp;H9920 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=""font-family: Times New Roman;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br /><strong>CONTRACT TITLE:<span style=""font-family: Times New Roman;"">&nbsp;SUPPLY &amp; INSTALLATION OF MEDICAL&nbsp;<span style=""font-family: 'Bookman Old Style',serif;"">EQUIPMENT, ICT EQUIPMENT AND VARIOUS CONSUMABLES</span></span></strong><br /><strong>REFERENCE NO</strong><span style=""font-family: 'Bookman Old Style',serif; letter-spacing: -0.1pt;"">.:</span><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.1pt;"">&nbsp;<strong>MOHS/IHPAU/HSG/ICB/09/2017/002</strong>&nbsp;</span><br />&nbsp;<br />The Ministry of Health &amp; Sanitation has received financing from the World Bank toward the cost of Health Systems Strengthening Sector from the Ebola Emergency Response Project residual funds and intends to apply part of the proceeds towards payments under the contract:&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>The supply &amp; installation of medical equipment &amp; ICT equipment for the Ministry of Health &amp; Sanitation.&nbsp;</strong></p>; <p><strong>The Ministry of Health &amp; Sanitation, through the Integrated Health Projects Administration Unit &ndash; (IHPAU)</strong><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.1pt;"">&nbsp;now invites sealed bids from eligible bidders for the Supply &amp; Installation of Various Medical Equipment.&nbsp;</span>Bidders may bid for one or several lots/contracts, as further defined in the bidding document. &nbsp;Bidders wishing to offer discounts in case they are awarded more than one contract will be allowed to do so provided those discounts are included in the Letter of Bid.<br />&nbsp;<br />Bidding will be conducted through the&nbsp;<em><strong>International Competitive Bidding</strong></em>&nbsp;procedures as specified in the World Bank's&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.worldbank.org/html/opr/procure/guidelin.html""><em>Guidelines:&nbsp;Procurement of Goods, Works and Non-Consulting Services under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits &amp; Grants by World Bank Borrowers</em></a>&nbsp;Procurement Guidelines dated January, 2011 and revised in July 2014 in addition to the relevant Articles of the Sierra Leone Public procurement Act 2004&nbsp;revised in 2016 and is open to all eligible bidders as defined in the Procurement Guidelines.

The activity established regional offices in Addis Ababa (co-located with the national office), Bahir Dar, Adama, Hawassa, Dessie and satellite offices in Mekelle and Dire Dawa to provide technical assistance and facilitate close monitoring of activities implemented by sub partners.</p>    <p>PSI in conjunction with Handicap International and Ethiopian Public Health Association ensured the mainstreaming of disability into HIV programming and improved evidence for HIV prevention. Twenty-five local implementing partners were sub-granted to provide behavioral intervention through peer educators; drop in centers (DIC) have been stablished for the provision of behavioral, biomedical and structural interventions for key populations; and public and private facilities have been networked to increase access to clinical services for targeted populations through referral and linkages.</p>; <p><strong>PURPOSE</strong></p>    <p>The purpose of the end-line evaluation is to analyze the effectiveness of the activity in contributing to the national target of reducing new infections by targeting key and priority population in the community; and analyze achievement in selected indicators. The findings of the end-line evaluation will be used to inform future HIV prevention activities. The primary audience for the results of the evaluation is USAID/Ethiopia. In conjunction with the previous baseline and midterm evaluations for these activities, results of this evaluation will be used to analyze factors that contribute to reducing new infections through reducing behavioral risk factors among most-at-risk populations over the course of the activity and to draw lessons to inform future HIV prevention projects. In addition, implementing partners will use the findings to identify the areas of success and challenges in implementation and gain insights into how performance could be improved. Finally, the host country government, especially the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH), HIV Prevention and Control Office (HAPCO) and other relevant local government stakeholders will use the analysis to identify the opportunities to continue to improved services for key and priority populations and to inform planning for future HIV prevention programming.</p>    <p>The MULU/MARPs activity takes a systems approach to meet the needs of key and priority populations. The goal of the project is to reduce the number of new HIV infections in Ethiopia. The activity has three primary objectives:</p>    <p>1) To prevent new HIV infections by reducing behavioral risk factors among most-at-risk populations and other highly vulnerable population</p>    <p>2) To strengthen community level systems and structures to support combination prevention</p>    <p>3) To increase the capacity of the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) to lead HIV prevention interventions that are based on the local epidemiology of new infections</p>"271171,Tender,"Provision of Repair and Maintenance Services for Medical and Laboratory Equipment; ; <div class=""reportRow""><label for=""NoticeType"">Type of notice:&nbsp;</label><span class=""value"">Request for EOI</span></div>    <div class=""reportRow""><label for=""RegistrationLevel"">Registration level:&nbsp;</label><span class=""value""><label>Basic</label></span></div>    <div class=""reportRow""><label for=""Title"">Title:&nbsp;</label><span id=""noticeTitle"" class=""value"">Contract for the Provision of Repair and Maintenance Services for Medical and Laboratory Equipm ...</span></div>    <div class=""reportRow""><label for=""AgencyId"">UN organization:&nbsp;</label><span class=""value"">United Nations Secretariat</span></div>    <div class=""reportRow""><label for=""Reference"">Reference:&nbsp;</label><span class=""value"">EOIUNIFIL14486</span></div>    <div class=""reportRow""><label for=""DatePublished"">Published:&nbsp;</label><span class=""value"">20-Nov-2017</span></div>    <div class=""reportRow""><label for=""Deadline"">Deadline:&nbsp;</label><span class=""value"">05-Dec-2017 00:00</span></div>    <div class=""reportRow""><label for=""Timezone"">Time zone:&nbsp;</label><span class=""value"">(GMT 0.00) Western Europe Time, London, Lisbon, Casablanca</span></div>    <div class=""reportRow"">&nbsp;</div>; <p>The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has a mandate to support the implementation of the Security Council Resolution 1701.

However, Ethiopia still has the sixth highest number of child deaths, with 184,000 (UN-IGME 2015:24) under the age of five children dying each year. Neonatal conditions, pneumonia and diarrhoea # with malnutrition as an important underlying factor # continue to be the top killers of children under the age of five in Ethiopia. Because of the slow progress in reducing neonatal mortality, the proportional contribution of neonatal mortality to under-five mortality is increasing, and currently stands at 47% in Ethiopia (UN-IGME 2015). This burden is even greater for the large rural and the most disadvantaged population due to poor access and utilization of maternal, new-born and child health services. Effective coverage for life saving high impact new-born and child health interventions has been steadily increasing. Yet, access to and utilization of the interventions have not been uniform across all sections of the population. There is a limited care-seeking among children under two months of age due to socioeconomic barriers, traditional practices and limited knowledge and information. As indicated in the 2016 # 2020 National Health Promotion and communication Strategy, despite high health service coverage, low health service utilization has been identified as health promotion and communication gaps shown at individual, community and socio-economic environmental levels.

This rapid scaling up (between 2009 and 2011) was facilitated by the global evolution of the treatment of malnutrition and the adoption of a management protocol for SAM based on the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated SAM cases, using Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTF).&nbsp;Niger has developed its first malnutrition management protocol in 2005, updated later in 2011 and 2016, in line with evolving global guidelines.<br />Currently, management of SAM is an integral part of routine primary health care and is functional in all ITCs and hospitals in the country (922 health facilities in total, including 44 national, regional and district hospitals), as well as in some health huts with qualified staff.<br />UNICEF and its partners treated an average of 370,000 children annually, including 55,000 to 60,000 (15% - 20%) SAM children with medical complications and requiring intensive hospital care.<br />&nbsp;The number of children cared for annually is almost 100% of the estimated target.&nbsp;However, coverage surveys carried out at the level of a few health districts suggest that the coverage of PCIMAS at the national level would not reach 50%, which suggests that the methodology used at the international level to multiply the number of children under 5 by the prevalence of SAM and applying a correction factor (2.6) to account for the incidence would underestimate the number of children with SAM in Niger .&nbsp;A recent study indicates that the correction factor in the Niger context is 2 to 5 times higher than the current one.</p>    <p><strong>Partnership</strong><br />The program is led by the Ministry of Health with UNICEF support for the procurement and distribution of RUTF and other inputs up to the level of health districts, overall technical support including training, monitoring / supervision, integration of screening with other interventions already in place; support for regular surveys / evaluations; and contribution to the costs of human resources of health workers in some hospital settings.&nbsp;NGOs, directly funded by ECHO or their own funding (eg MSFs) support the day-to-day running of the program, including the cost of human resources at CSIs and hospitals, as well as the transportation of inputs from health districts to CSIs .<br />In 2017, UNICEF put in place a pilot supply chain management system to ensure the distribution and control of supplies (in RUTF, micronutrient supplementation, and selected essential drugs) of health districts to health facilities.&nbsp;This pilot covers the regions of Maradi and Zinder, which account for nearly 60% of SAM cases supported.&nbsp;This system is based on private sector carriers, responsible for transporting nutritional inputs from health districts to CSIs, with the district chief medical officer at the center of the device.&nbsp;Indeed, it is he who is in charge of contacting the carriers, transmitting the quantities of inputs to be transported and verifying that the quantities have been delivered.&nbsp;This pilot project started in October 2017 and will provide detailed information on the cost and efficiency of using private carriers to supply health facilities.&nbsp;This data will in turn be used to encourage the government to mobilize funds for the transport of nutritional inputs.<br />The Nutrition Cluster was officially activated in Niger in 2010. In 2012, following a request from Nutrition partners, particularly those involved in early recovery and development sectors, the cluster changed its name to become the Nutrition Technical Group ( GTN), coordinated by the Nutrition Directorate with UNICEF as co-coordinator.&nbsp;The NWG meets on a monthly basis and coordinates development interventions as well as nutritional emergencies.<br />In parallel with this national coordinating body, the NGOs funded by ECHO created in 2013, under ECHO funding, the Alliance, another coordination body made up of 4 subcommittees (Nutrition, Food Security, Monitoring-Evaluation and Advocacy). .&nbsp;The Alliance was created with the aim of fostering synergy between nutrition and food security interventions for maximum impact in setting up a sustainable malnutrition management system.&nbsp;The NGO members of the Alliance are also members of the GTN.&nbsp;The role of the Alliance within the NWG remains to be defined.</p>    <p><strong>Results / impact of the program</strong><br />Over the last decade, 2.6 million children have been admitted to SAM management programs, with performance indicators exceeding international minimum standards (SPHERE standards), thus contributing to the reduction of mortality among children under five in Niger [4].&nbsp;In the 44 hospitals, the support of NGOs and the consequent investments for the treatment of SAM helped to strengthen the overall care at the level of pediatric services.&nbsp;In total in 2015, approximately 130,000 children (including more than 55,000 severely malnourished children) were treated in pediatric services supported by NGOs.<br />The program has thus contributed to significant capacity building in the country.&nbsp;For example, the number of people involved in the nutrition response within the government / Ministry of Health has evolved from a team of 3 people in 2007 to a Nutrition Directorate employing more than 40 people including nutrition focal points at the national level. regions and districts.<br />The program has also helped to support certain preventive approaches such as IYCF promotion and counseling, WASH in Nut activities and the integration of SAM screening into health programs such as the IMCI-community or the chemo program. seasonal malaria prophylaxis (SPC) covering 28 of Niger's 44 districts and affecting more than 2.6 million children each year.&nbsp;As shown in Chart 4, the results of the 2016 CPS campaign coupled with early detection of SAM led to a decrease in hospitalizations of SAM children during the lean season (July to November).<br />In this dynamic of change and innovation, Niger has developed its first-ever multisectoral nutrition security policy in 2015, followed by a budgeted action plan and a cost-effectiveness analysis of specific nutritional interventions (2017).</p>    <p><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE EVALUATION AND EXPECTED RESULTS</strong><br />The overall objective is to conduct an in-depth assessment of the MAS support services scaled up over the last 10 years and to identify lessons learned and other elements that may confirm or invalidate the relevance, effectiveness the efficiency and sustainability of the actions put in place.&nbsp;This information will help rethink and reorient the SAM program at the national level and inform UNICEF's next programming cycle.</p>    <p><font><font>Specifically, this assessment will answer the following questions while taking into account the equity factor (gender, age, geographic location, etc.):</font></font></p>    <ul>    <li><font><font>What are the actual geographic and population coverage rates of the program?</font></font></li>    <li><font><font>What is the effectiveness and efficiency of the program in its current structure (described in Sections 1 and 2) taking into account the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders?</font></font></li>    <li><font><font>To what extent can existing innovative approaches in Niger (eg PB-mother / PB-household, use of private transporters to manage part of the supply chain, etc.) contribute to the efficiency and sustainability of the project?

Later on, in 2005, the MoPH developed the Essential Package of Hospital Services (EPHS), which defined the role and services of the hospital sector, specifically for the district, provincial and regional hospitals and aims to reduce high maternal and childhood mortality rates.</p>    <p>Based on its experiences with BPHS implementation, for the first time the MOPH refined the BPHS in 2005 and then a full review of the BPHS was undertaken in 2010. The revised version of BPHS identified new priority areas which need to be considered by relevant partners. Major changes introduced in the second revision are in mental health, disability and nutrition. In addition, the revised package recognizes new types of health facilities (Health Sub-center and Mobile Health Teams) to increase the accessibility to health care to people living in remote and isolated areas. Furthermore, health care to underserved population such as detainees is also added in the revised BPHS.</p>    <p>The delivery of BPHS and EPHS (in part) has been financing by the three main donors (the World Bank, EU and USAID), and implementing by Consultants (through contracting-out approach) and the MOPH Strengthening Mechanism since 2003.

System; ; <p><strong><label class=""control-label"">Opportunity Background</label></strong></p>    <p><strong>Overview </strong></p>    <p>WHO is the lead global normative agency with responsibility to guide countries on measures to prevent, monitor, and contain HIVDR. WHO and its partner organisations and experts of the HIVResNet group developed a global strategy for the surveillance and monitoring of HIVDR in 2004, which was further updated in 2014. The strategy generates data on the emergence and transmission of HIVDR and equips countries with information to select first and second line antiretroviral therapy regimens. Through concept notes and guidance, WHO has provided technical support to countries on how to conduct surveillance activities. WHO regularly reports on the prevalence of resistance (see http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/drugresistance/en/). Recently WHO released the 2017 HIVDR report, which provides a contemporary account of the global situation of HIVDR based on standardised survey methods. The report highlights worrying trends in the levels of HIVDR across all regions. Pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR) or drug resistance in people starting therapy is increasing in low- and middle-income countries and particularly in Eastern and Southern Africa. Notably in 6 of 11 countries reporting nationally representative survey data, over 10% of individuals who initiated ART had virus resistance to efavirenz (EFV) and /or nevirapine (NVP), the most affordable and widely used NNRTI ARV drugs as part of the first-line ART. The 2017 HIVDR report also demonstrates that uptake of HIVDR surveys by countries has increased significantly with over 25 countries planning to implement HIVDR surveys in 2017-2018. In July 2017 WHO also launched the Global Action Plan on HIVDR (GAP) which provides a framework for coordinated action at all levels to prevent, monitor and respond to HIVDR. The GAP was developed in collaboration with partners and stakeholders and includes 5 strategic objectives. The framework outlines key actions for all partners involved in the global response to HIVDR over a 5 year period (2017-2021), and links to indicators to track implementation of the plan ( HIV Drug Resistance Global Action Plan 2017- 2021).</p>    <p><strong>Objectives of the activity</strong></p>    <p>The consultant will assist WHO/HIV/TAC with Technical expert support to WHO&rsquo;s work on HIV drug resistance. Specifically, the consultant will support the development and maintenance of the laboratory quality assurance system developed by the WHO for HIVDR testing. The Consultant is required to support the management of the network of WHO/HIVResNet Laboratories, and to perform sequence data quality assurance and analysis.</p>    <p><strong>Activity coordination</strong></p>    <p>The activity coordination will be done under the supervision of the medical officer in charge of HIV drug resistance, in the TAC Unit of the HIV/AIDS department.</p>    <p><strong>Work to be performed</strong></p>    <p>The HIV Department now finds itself in need of technical support for the WHO HIV Drug Resistance Laboratory Network.

To address this, WHO has issued&nbsp;Consolidated Guidelines on HIV testing and a supplement on partner notification and HIV self-testing to&nbsp;guide countries toward implementing effective HIV testing approaches.</p>    <p>Many countries are now adopting HIVST as part of their testing approaches, therefore WHO is requested&nbsp;to provide technical support and specific guidance for the introduction or implementation of HIVST.&nbsp;This consultancy will focus on collecting key and relevant information about HIV testing activities in&nbsp;country and to support countries to implement WHO recommendations.</p>; <p><strong>Objective of the RFP</strong><br />The purpose of this Request for Proposals (RFP) is to enter into a contractual agreement with a&nbsp;successful bidder and select a suitable contractor to carry out the following work: to support the Key populations and Innovative Prevention (KPP) team on HIV testing services and HIV self-testing. The&nbsp;overall aim is to provide support to the development of evidence, guidance, tools and reports with regard&nbsp;to HTS/HIVST and provide technical support in the implementation of HTS/HIVST in countries.&nbsp;</p>    <p>WHO is an Organization that is dependent on the budgetary and extra-budgetary contributions it receives&nbsp;for the implementation of its activities.

In case of a consortium this criterion must be fulfilled by each member.</li>    </ul>    <p>2) Professional capacity of candidate (based on items 4 and 5 of the application form). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last 3 years from submission deadline.</p>    <ul>    <li>candidate (i.e. the consortium as a whole, in the case of application by a consortium) shall demonstrate an existence of at least 3 years of professional experience in the field of the contract. For the purpose of the assessment of this criteria, professional certificate by the deputed entity attesting this information will have to be provided,</li>    <li>at least 4 permanent staff currently work for the candidate in fields related to this contract.</li>    </ul>    <p>3) Technical capacity of candidate (based on items 5 and 6 of the application form).

The candidate has provided services under at least 3 contracts each with a budget of at least EUR 600 000 each in technical assistance in fields related to this contract (projects and programmes in the agriculture and/or food and nutrition sectors) in the last 3 years (2015, 2016 and 2017) in developing countries for which the source of funding was a development partner.</p>    <p>This means that the projects the candidate refers to could have been started or completed at any time during the indicated period, but it does not necessarily have to be started and completed during that period, nor implemented during the entire period. Candidates /tenderers are allowed to refer either to projects completed within the reference period (although started earlier) or to projects not yet completed. In the first case the project will be considered in its whole if proper evidence of performance is provided (statement or certificate from the entity which awarded the contract, proof of final payment). In case of projects still on-going only the portion satisfactorily completed will be considered. This portion will have to be supported by documentary evidence (similarly to projects completed) also detailing its value.</p>    <p>If a candidate /tenderer has implemented the project in a consortium, the percentage that the candidate/tenderer has successfully completed must be clear from the documentary evidence, together with a description of the nature of the services provided if the selection criteria relating to the pertinence of the experience have been used. Evidence of technical capability and experience is to be provided in the form of letters of satisfactory performance or equivalent issued by the contracting authorities involved. Letters issued by parties other than contracting authorities will not be accepted.

Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same<br />Rules of eligibility - notably that of nationality &ndash; and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. With regard to technical and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the works or services for which these capacities are required. With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies, become jointly and severally liable for the performance of the contract.</p>    <p>If more than 8 eligible candidates meet the above selection criteria, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the applications of these candidates must be reexamined to identify the eight best candidates.

PHR&rsquo;s specialized expertise is used to advocate for persecuted health workers, prevent torture, document mass atrocities, and hold those who violate human rights accountable. PHR&rsquo;s work focuses on the physical and psychological effects of torture and sexual violence, the forensic documentation of attacks on civilians, the unnecessary and excessive use of force during civil unrest, and the protection of medical institutions and health professionals working on the frontline of human rights crises.</p>    <h3><strong>Results</strong></h3>    <p>PHR teams exposed the use of&nbsp;<a title=""Winds of Death"" href=""http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/library/reports/iraq-winds-of-death-poison-gas-kurds-1989.html"">chemical weapons against civilians in Iraq</a>&nbsp;and carried out historic exhumations of mass graves in Bosnia and Rwanda for international tribunals. During the past decade, these teams have also provided evidence for criminal investigations into torture and extrajudicial executions in numerous countries &ndash; including Colombia, Honduras, Libya, Mexico, Peru, and Sierra Leone &ndash; to ensure accountability for serious human rights violations and mass atrocities.

We focus on the critical role of forensic science, clinical medicine, and public health research in ensuring that human rights abuses are properly documented using the most rigorous scientific methodologies possible. Our experts use epidemiology, medical and psychological evaluations, autopsies, forensic anthropology, and crime scene analysis to document serious abuses, including murder, torture, rape, starvation, forced displacement, and civilian attacks. PHR&rsquo;s human rights training and mentoring emphasize medicine and science as the foundation of every aspect of evidence collection, documentation, and implementation of international norms and standards. We provide credible evidence, data, and research to corroborate allegations of human rights violations not only to prevent future abuses, but also to ensure the prosecution of perpetrators by courts, tribunals, and truth commissions.</p>"21070,Organization,"Consuelo Foundation: <div>Consuelo Foundation is an operating foundation registered under laws of the United States of America.

Bede - poet, scientist, historian and the greatest European scholar of the 7th century - is buried in Durham, as is St Cuthbert, who established 'English' Christianity from its Celtic and Roman roots. The Lindisfarne Gospels, 'one of the great landmarks of human cultural achievement', were produced nearby and resided in Durham with the body of St Cuthbert until the 16th century when they were removed to London - our 'Gospel Book' is returning to Durham in 2013. The 'Cuthbert Community' became one of the richest in Europe, with lands extending from the Tyne to the Tees and beyond. This scholarly, monastic community was a precursor of the modern University tradition which spread across Europe and around the world. Durham's 11th century Norman Cathedral was built between 1096 and 1130 and is one of the world's truly great buildings. Durham Castle, now part of the University, dates from 1072 and was the seat of the all-powerful Prince-Bishops who wielded secular and religious power over much of the North of England, with their own armies, system of taxation and coinage - until the end of the Prince-Bishopric in 1832 Durham was effectively a state within a state.</p>    <p>Durham became one of England's leading centres of medieval scholarship, along with Oxford and Cambridge. Indeed, three Colleges - now part of Oxford University - were founded from Durham (University College and Balliol College, and in 1286 Durham College was run from Durham to train scholars for Durham for 300 years until it became incorporated into the University of Oxford as Trinity College). Henry VIII and Oliver Cromwell's attempts to formally establish a University for the North in Durham were subsumed by politics and North-South rivalries, and it was not until 1832, as the Prince-Bishopric declined lost his powers, was Durham finally endowed with the Castle and lands and granted degree awarding powers by the king as England's third University. Durham University is the inheritor of a continuous line of learning and scholarship dating from Bede and Cuthbert to the present day.</p>    <p>Durham has always been a modern, forward-looking University. With a medieval World Heritage Site at their heart, their new buildings continue the tradition of important and innovative architecture. Durham was one of the first universities to admit women on an equal footing to men (1890), to establish medical training (1834) and the first to award Civil and Mining Engineering degrees to meet regional and national needs during the industrial revolution (1838). Durham led in the development of science and established one of the earliest observatories in England. Durham University was based in two cities for over 100 years, its medical school at King's College and other Colleges in Newcastle becoming the new and independent University of Newcastle in 1963. Durham was also the first University to establish overseas campuses a century before the concept was reinvented: in Barbados in 1875 and Sierra Leone in 1876. In 1992 the University established a significant presence at their Queen's Campus in the heart of Tees Valley, reinitiating medical teaching and breaking disciplinary boundaries to enhance public health and social well being.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>"22415,Organization,"Metis Advisory Group: <p>They are an independent insurance brokerage firm that specializes in all forms of ""voluntary"" insurance.

Each time an infant is safely buckled into a car seat or a child wears a bicycle helmet correctly, you see the work of CICH. Every time you fill your car with unleaded gasoline, you're helping protect children from the harmful effects of lead - thanks to CICH's efforts. And when a new parent knows to put a baby to sleep on her back, reducing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, CICH has reached out to another child.</p>    <p>From research and policy recommendations to community development and resource-building the Institute has touched the life of virtually every child in Canada.</p>    <p>Founded in 1977, CICH is the only national charitable organization dedicated solely to improving the health of children and youth in Canada. The Institute has had a profound impact on the policies and practices of caring for children through its three core areas of focus:</p>    <ul>    <li>- monitoring children's health</li>    <li>- educating professionals, caregivers and policy-makers</li>    <li>- advocating for legislation and policies that improve child health</li>    </ul>    <p>As a trusted voice for children, CICH speaks out on issues involving children and youth to all levels of government, media, parents and caregivers. Governed by a volunteer board of directors and guided by an expert advisory council, the Institute plays a key role in working with government and industry to bring attention to significant children's health care issues and ensuring appropriate policies are developed. CICH then translates those policies into better health for children by equipping health care professionals and educators with the best evidence-based resources.</p>    <p>The Institute provides expert advice to Canadian media, ensuring the needs and concerns of children are reported. They&nbsp;also reach out to families across Canada to help with the crucial tasks of nurturing, protecting, educating and empowering children.</p>    <p><strong>Five Pillars</strong></p>    <p>Reaching across the themes of monitoring, education and advocacy, the Institute's work is strategically focussed on five pillars of child health:</p>    <ul>    <li>- Acting as a voice for Canada's children</li>    <li>- Supporting healthy pregnancy and childbirth</li>    <li>- Fostering healthy child development</li>    <li>- Ensuring the environment is safe for children</li>    <li>- Monitoring the state of children's health</li>    </ul>"22686,Organization,"World University Service of Canada - WUSC (Entraide Universitaire Mondiale du Canada - EUMC): <p>WUSC is a leading Canadian development agency, which focuses on human development and global understanding through education and training.

The UHRC&rsquo;s demonstration programs utilize community organizing to establish women&rsquo;s community groups consisting of slum-dwelling women who advocate for community-level infrastructure improvements.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>History and outline of UHRC operations</strong></p>    <p>UHRC was established in 2005 as a registered non-profit company under India&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act,_1956"">Companies Act, 1956</a>&nbsp;with the aim of working towards socio-economic empowerment, improved quality of life, health, nutrition, and general well-being for urban disadvantaged families. Its startup was supported by&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USAID"">USAID</a>&nbsp;between 2004 and 2005, but as of 2009, the UHRC no longer receives USAID financial support.</p>    <p>UHRC implements demonstration programs among slum-dwelling populations in cities (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indore"">Indore</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agra"">Agra</a>, and more recently North-East Delhi) with the intention that they be adapted, replicated and up-scaled by other government and non-government agencies. These demonstration programs focus simultaneously on community empowerment to enhance demand for services and on working with the service providers to improve supply side responsiveness to meet the increased demand. Since slum-dwellers are usually not connected to the mainstream population, part of the UHRC&rsquo;s ground work involves proactive community mobilization, encouragement and outreach to identify vulnerable populations and facilitate their connection to social and economic sector service providers such as healthcare, living environment services, house improvement services and employment programs.</p>    <p>UHRC programs facilitate the formation of women's and children's groups to strengthen the social cohesion in slums and to address gender inequity. The program works toward building their capacity to take charge of processes that affect family economics, health, education, nutrition, housing improvement and overall social well-being. UHRC provides targeted trainings and workshops to community groups on topics such as a) acquiring knowledge, b) building negotiations skills (such as sending collective application to civic authorities) and, c) interfacing with diverse government agencies to improve slum living environments and access to health, nutrition and social entitlements. Slum communities in UHRC program cities participate in health education and promotion sessions facilitated by UHRC field workers on topics such as maternal and child health, nutrition, hygiene, and environmental health.</p>    <p>As the number of community groups in a local region reaches a critical mass, they are networked into a larger congress or cluster-team of women's groups, consisting of democratically agreed-upon representatives from each group. Cluster-level teams of women's groups and slum-level groups receive regular supervision, mentoring support and materials (such as steel containers to store registers, charts, behaviour promotion materials, floor mats to sit during meetings) from UHRC teams to carry out meetings and activities working towards improved health and well-being. UHRC partners with participating community groups and federations to help them access available services, schemes and resources. Groups and cluster-team members are also coached on negotiation skills and provided trainings on how to effectively negotiate with healthcare providers and other civic authorities through dialogue and formal applications to obtain health services and environmental services such as road paving, drain installation, sanitation/water infrastructure, garbage removal, and other entitlements.</p>    <p>Along with running the demonstration programs, UHRC also provides technical support to the government (at national, provincial, and city levels) and non-government agencies in the form of research, advocacy, and knowledge dissemination. Additionally, the UHRC central and field offices provides trainings, internships, and volunteer options for students from different universities in India and abroad. All interns and volunteers, who in the past eight years have included Masters and PhD students, have learnt from field based participatory action research in UHRC's program sites.</p>    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>    <h3>UHRC programs</h3>    <h4>Health outreach, service access, and behavior promotion</h4>    <p>Some of the first activities the UHRC encourages slum women to discuss and analyze health, well-being challenges faced by their families and the community as a whole. UHRC helps a new slum women&rsquo;s group with are health activism training and advocacy of healthy household practices. Through workshops and training sessions, women&rsquo;s groups are encouraged to begin promoting healthy practices and health seeking behaviors in their communities, such as going to the hospital when a woman goes into labor. This process involves training women&rsquo;s group members to become social health activists so they can conduct preventive and promotive health workshops and sessions for their peers. An aspect of this training is encouraging women&rsquo;s group members to promote cultural and religious traditions that are relevant to their communities, while incorporating educational curriculums surrounding proper hygiene and healthy behaviors for new mothers. One example is that UHRC women&rsquo;s groups often hold group&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annaprashan"">Annaprashan</a>&nbsp;ceremonies (a ceremony wherein a child is first fed food other than milk), incorporating curriculums surrounding ante-natal child care.</p>    <p>UHRC also trains group members on reaching out to private and public healthcare providers such as&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_nurse_midwife"">Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anganwadi"">Anganwadi</a>&nbsp;centers to run health camps in their communities. At the 13th World Congress on Public Health, the UHRC reported improvements in slum residents&rsquo; access to health services and information and adoption of healthy behaviors in intervention areas. Furthermore, they noted that as of 2009, 70% of children in intervention areas were completely immunized as opposed to 28% in areas that had not yet developed UHRC programs [https://wfpha.confex.com/wfpha/2012/webprogram/Paper10702.html]</p>    <p>In addition to advocacy and education, UHRC women's groups also play a direct role in linking women in urban slums to health services. Women's group members frequently escort married adolescent migrant girls to hospitals for safer deliveries when they go into labor, and to ante-natal services which they may not otherwise be familiar with [Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Government of India. Guidelines for developing city level urban health projects, New Delhi: Government of India: 2005].</p>    <h4>&nbsp;</h4>    <h4>Collective savings/social resilience funds</h4>    <p>Once groups have developed a regular meeting schedule and have undertaken some basic health outreach activities, the UHRC proposes to groups that they could form a collective savings fund. These collective savings funds are essentially a method of risk pooling. Groups decide upon a certain monthly or weekly contribution that each member needs to make to grow their fund. All contributions to the pool are recorded by a treasurer who is elected by the group. The women are facilitated to establish standards for mutual accountability. The UHRC aids in establishing a record keeping system and in training the women to keep these records up to date &ndash; trainings cover how to track and record collective savings, loans given from the savings pool, interest received along with the principal amount, and essential elements of managing savings and loans. When a member or even a non-member family is in need of a loan, women&rsquo;s groups can provide low to zero interest loans (for example one group in Agra, Saraswati Mahila Swasth Samiti, has adopted a 2% interest rate). Collecting payments, managing the fund, and administering all loans is facilitated by women&rsquo;s group members with support from UHRC's team members. These funds play a crucial role in reducing the burden of health care costs on poor families, particularly during health emergencies. Loans are given for a variety of needs: a) Maternal and Child Health, b) Health emergencies, c) Prevention of school drop-outs, d) House improvements, e) Food insecurity, f) starting or strengthening women's small enterprise from home or nearby market, g) starting or expansion of men's small enterprises, h) Repaying debts from money-lender, and i) Social and family expenditures.</p>    <h4>&nbsp;</h4>    <h4>Petition writing and infrastructure improvement</h4>    <h4>Based on its initial experience with the program in Indore, and Agra, beginning November 2009, UHRC program strategies have evolved towards a broader development of the urban slums/vulnerable populations goal. UHRC has found educating communities about government resources and services to be particularly effective. As groups bring municipal problems forward, the UHRC will suggest that communities begin writing applications and letters to service providers, and holds trainings and workshops where group members can practice writing applications and learn about the importance of making and filing copies of all applications and letters that submitted. Field workers encourage groups to write highly specific, concrete requests that focus on a single issue rather than multiple issues to increase chances of success. They are also encouraged to have all members sign each request or petition to show consensus.</h4>    <p>Usually the first few petitions or letters written are followed by a period of struggle or stagnancy. Municipal service providers and government officials tend to be initially unresponsive and uncooperative. Group members are therefore trained to write reminders following up on requests and to seek formal receipts from civic authorities for any communications sent. For example, group members are trained to send reminders through the government postal system, which automatically provides receipts to senders.</p>    <p>Women&rsquo;s groups also learn to recruit the support of democratically elected ward representatives who can help in interfacing with municipal corporations. UHRC social facilitators guide women's group members to start by pursuing simple tasks, such as getting a street drain cleaned, before moving on to more ambitious projects such as road paving and water supply installation.</p>    <h4>&nbsp;</h4>    <h4>Social awareness and advocacy</h4>    <p>UHRC women&rsquo;s groups have also begun organizing rallies around community needs, such as ousting alcohol vendors to disincentivize alcoholism, demonstrating against gambling to protect household finances, advocating against domestic violence, or organizing public health advocacy campaigns. Groups have also orchestrated sit ins at government offices to urge them to be responsive to community needs and requests by providing services, such as slum street paving, drain installation, water supply and sewage system installation, health and nutrition services, food security services, and access to government's social welfare schemes such as education scholarship, widows' pension scheme, old-age pension scheme.</p>    <h4>&nbsp;</h4>    <h4>Government scheme awareness and application support</h4>    <p>Through engagement with its target populations in Indore, Agra, and Delhi, the UHRC began focusing its efforts on helping slum residents attain proper identification documentation. Slum residents, and particularly migrant adolescents living within urban slums, who do not have proper documentation face barriers such as ineligibility for government welfare programs and education scholarships as well as housing insecurity. The UHRC assists women's group members to learn about and apply for various forms of picture ID, voter ID, proof-of-address, and other documentation.</p>    <h3>Source:&nbsp;Montgomery, Mark R.; Balk, Deborah; Liu, Zhen; Agarwal, Siddharth; Jones, Eleri; Adamo, Susana (2016-01-01).

After a long and destructive civil war, complicated cold-war relationships, aborted peace accords, and failed elections, Angola is now at peace. Angola had two rounds of successful democratic elections, and has developed a new constitution. The political and economic systems, nascent though they may be, have evolved from what has been characterized as postcolonial Marxist-Leninism into a multiparty democracy and market economy. Yet the country struggles with poverty, an infrastructure network that is still being rebuilt, a system of public administration in need of modernization, and a seemingly variable space for dissenting voices. </p>        <p> The U.S. Agency for International Developments (USAID) five-year Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) recognizes Angolas growing economy, rising regional status, and remaining development challenges. As Angola emerges into the ranks of middle-income countries, it provides a genuine opportunity for USAID to begin a successful transformation of its relationship    with this significant U.S. trading partner and important Southern Africa ally. This five-year strategy will chart the course for a transition from a donor/recipient relationship to one of development partners, where Angola will finance and manage its continued economic and social development with limited, catalytic technical assistance and direct engagement from USAID. </p>        <p> USAID engagement will be two-fold: the first will be increased catalytic technical assistance to government ministries involved in public administration, financial management, and other pillars of health system strengthening; the second will be an expanded effort to engage the private sector and civil society in reaching the countrys development objectives. To accomplish this transformation, USAID will continue to support the GRAs own institution building initiatives by providing technical assistance, training, and supportive supervision in the larger health sector. At the same time, USAID will launch a reinvigorated public-private partnership (PPP) strategy using a shared value approach where partnerships center on the intersection of development and business objectives, resulting in the GRA and other national stakeholders finding and implementing solutions together. During 2000-2005, USAID/Angola was perceived as an Agency leader in PPPs, something of a poster child for successfully using such partnerships and alliances to great    programmatic effect. USAID will play an integral role in this process by bringing innovative solutions to the table and providing facilitation as well as catalytic technical assistance for sustainable development. Consultations with the GRA over this transformative CDCS have revealed a mutual desire to partner in development as proposed herein. </p>        <p> Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) in Angola will track successes and shortcomings of all ongoing USAID-funded projects and programs to ensure Presidential Initiative and USAID targets are met through solid data collection and analysis, and regular USAID monitoring and evaluation to make adjustments to the program to ensure progress and achievement towards the CDCS Goal. MEL will specifically include tracking stated targets pertaining to increased gender equity and youth engagement. Considering the importance of meeting the capacity building and technical assistance needs of the GRA to effectively implement the National Development Plan, USAID will continue to strengthen its own internal capacity and that of its partners to better provide the required support. </p>"51044,Funding Info,"New Equity Investment Deal to Provide Easy Access to World-class Diagnostic Services for Millions of Pakistanis: <p> The UK-funded Karandaaz will triple the impact of a leading health diagnostic service provider and set up a unique warehouse for agricultural produce in Punjab.

Its Headquarters is located at Addis Ababa, capital city of Ethiopia. The African Union is implementing the AU Plan of Action on Drug Control (2013-2018) whose fundamental goal is to improve health, security and socio-economic well-being of people of Africa by reducing illicit drug use, trafficking and associated crimes.</p>    <p>A key feature of the Plan is capacity building in research, information collection and development of monitoring systems. Africa has become a major transit route in the global trade in narcotics drugs with significant social and security challenges. The impact of illicit drugs on society includes negative health consequences associated with drug use, impact on productivity in monetary terms and costs associated with drug related crime. However, the real magnitude of the drug problem, especially in Africa, is largely unknown due to insufficient and even unreliable information.</p>    <p>Confronted with these challenges, the African Union Commission is working with all Member States and International partners to increase evidence based services for drug use problems through inter-alia the establishment of epidemiological networks and observatories to provide much needed evidence for policy formulation and service delivery.

The program is supported by two contracts: One contract supports testing medications in alcohol preferring rat strains. The second supports testing in alcohol drinking mice made dependent through chronic exposure to cycles of alcohol vapor exposure and withdrawal (CIE model), as well as in other models, as</div>    <div>needed. Although the program supports testing in mice and rats, it currently does not support the CIE model in rats that would allow direct comparison of drug effects in mice and rats using the same model.</div>    <div><br />This requirement is to support blind medication testing on alcohol drinking, negative affect measures and pain measures, in rats made alcohol dependent using the CIE model. The contract would support testing capacity of four (4) compounds per year over the next five (5) years. It will use mechanisms having intellectual property conditions favorable to compound providers when acquiring compounds from industry. This will eliminate a major barrier to testing optimized compounds and will stimulate interest by the pharmaceutical industry in developing high quality, marketable compounds for alcoholism.</div>    <div><br />The project objectives are as follows:</div>    <div><br />1. To assess effects of proprietary compounds in standardized models of alcohol dependence-induced alcohol intake, negative affect and pain sensitivity using both male and female rats as subjects.</div>    <div><br />2. To implement testing of proprietary compounds in a battery of &lsquo;control&rsquo; tests designed to aid in evaluating the selectivity and specificity of drug effects on alcohol intake in both male and female rats as subjects.</div>    <div><br />3. When requested, to assess effects of proprietary compounds on: (a) consumption of other fluids (sucrose); (b) general locomotor activity and interactions with alcohol; (c) alcohol induced hypnotic effects; and (d) alcohol pharmacokinetics, as measured by effects on blood alcohol elimination rates.</div>    <div><br />4. To collect, analyze, and display test data and provide compound study reports.</div>    <div>The data generated will be used in the identification of compounds for further</div>    <div>development.</div>    <div><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><br />Project Requirements</span></strong></div>    <div><br />1. Compound Testing</div>    <div><br />Test effects of compounds provided by NIAAA in voluntary limited-access drinking of unsweetened ethanol solutions in rats made dependent through repeated cycles of ethanol vapor exposure and withdrawal based on information provided by NIAAA. Two bottle choice or operant self-administration methods may be used. If requested by NIAAA, Contractor may have to purchase reference compounds for testing. All details of experimental protocols will be subject to the Government&rsquo;s concurrence. Testing protocols should conform to the following standards: a) justification of sample size, including power calculation; b) blind testing; and c) random or stratified assignment of subjects to experimental conditions. The Contractor may be asked to evaluate whether the test drug reached and engaged the intended target.</div>    <div><br />2. Compound Storage and Administration</div>    <div><br />Contractor shall store compounds supplied to them by NIAAA such that they cannot be readily accessed by personnel outside the Principle Investigator&rsquo;s laboratory. Adequate storage conditions, including -70 degree C freezers when noted, shall be available on site. The Contractor shall be responsible for providing all necessary reagents and supplies necessary for administering test medications according to instructions supplied by NIAAA.</div>    <div><br />3. Data Analysis and Reporting</div>    <div><br />Statistical analysis of the data, and preparation of a summary of the testing conditions and results including graphical displays is required. Interpretation of results written in language that can be understood by scientists not having specialized training in alcohol or addiction research is necessary.</div>    <div><br />4. Data Recording</div>    <div><br />Electronic record keeping of all proposed and/or tested experimental protocols, written using a strong scientific standard, with all details of the experiment recorded in such a way that another lab could replicate the study exactly, with notations regarding their status, is required.

An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>    <p>Background: <br />The Division of Intramural Population Health Research (DIPHR) is an intramural research division at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) whose mission is to improve population health across the life course by maximizing health and preventing disease [http://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/DIPHR/Pages/default.aspx]. The Division comprises the Office of the Director along with three research branches: Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Epidemiology, and Health Behavior. As an intramural research entity, the Division designs and conducts innovative, high-risk research aimed at answering critical data gaps regarding human fecundity, reproduction and development; pregnancy and delivery, including adverse pregnancy outcomes; offspring health, growth and development from birth to adulthood, and adolescent behavior. In addition, the Division conducts original methodologic research aimed at developing novel statistical tools for analytic purposes.</p>    <p>The Division's research focuses on various population subgroups including couples or individuals of reproductive age, pregnant women, infants, children, and adolescents. Increasingly, research is designed to assess the early origins of health and disease underscoring the need for the development of accurate methods for measuring environmental (non-genetic) exposures during sensitive windows of human development in the context of genetics, with the overarching goal of identifying population level interventions for maximizing health across the lifespan. The multi-faceted nature of the Division's research includes normative, etiologic and interventional research, examples which follow: 1) studies aimed at defining &lsquo;normal' or recruiting generally healthy participants include the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies and BioCycle Study, and 2) studies aimed at determining the relation between environmental (non-genetic) exposures (e.g., Upstate KIDS Study, ENDO Study and LIFE Study), 3) bio-behaviors (e.g., Naturalistic Teen Driving Studies and NEXT Study), and 4) genes (e.g., Diabetes and Women's Health and Genetic Determinants of Birth Defects) and a spectrum of outcomes.</p>    <p>In addition, the Division conducts interventional research involving but not restricted to families (e.g., CHEF Trial and FMOD Trial) and clinical populations (e.g., EAGeR Trial and FAZST Trial). The Division also conducts perinatal epidemiologic studies involving detailed collection of information from medical records (e.g. Consortium on Safe Labor and NICHD Consecutive Pregnancies Study).</p>    <p>Innovative and flexible research centers capable of implementing epidemiologic and behavioral research focusing on human reproduction; pregnancy; infant, child and adolescent health, growth and development; and human behavior are needed to assist the Division of Intramural Population Health Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), in the successful completion of original population health research. The breadth and complexity of population health research undertaken by Division investigators poses unique challenges with regard to several aspects: defining sampling frameworks that can be enumerated, incorporating varying units of analysis (e.g., individuals, menstrual or treatment cycles, couples, twins/siblings, families) into study designs; specifically targeted recruitment and retention of study participants; and longitudinal questionnaire data and biospecimen collection to capture of time-varying covariates and outcomes. Of note is the hierarchical data structure generated by much of the Division's research reflecting the recruitment of triads/dyads or genome wide analytic studies (GWAS) or multi-scale data from study participants (e.g., day, cycle, woman and couple level data collection for fecundity and fertility research, schools, census levels).</p>    <p>Therefore, DIPHR aims to establish three to five research support centers capable of implementing sophisticated initiatives, from preconception through adulthood, using scientifically valid and rigorous methodologies, to assist in the conduct of population health research initiatives. It is anticipated that initially 1-2 new research (observational cohorts and/or intervention trials) initiatives would be implemented each year utilizing one or more centers per initiative.</p>    <p>Potential sources must demonstrate and document the following in their capability statements:</p>    <p>&bull; Ability to recruit targeted and diverse population-based study cohorts (e.g., inclusive of vulnerable population subgroups such as pregnant women, infants, children, adolescents).

There are wide variations in chronic disease rates and other health factors in states across the country, and within each state. Poor nutrition and low levels of physical activity are significant risk factors for obesity and other chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, hypertension, certain cancers, and depression. These diseases are too common, very costly, and more likely to affect certain population groups at higher rates such as those of lower socioeconomic status. Physical activity and adequate nutrition early in life supports healthy growth and brain development, and protects against life-threatening and chronic diseases. However, a large percentage of Americans are not meeting recommended national guidelines for nutrition and physical activity.</p>    <p>For example,</p>    <ul>    <li>While 83% of mothers start to breastfeed, 60% of women stop breastfeeding earlier than they wanted, indicating that a large number of mothers need support to help them meet breastfeeding goals. In addition, fewer black infants (68.0%) are ever breastfed compared to white infants (85.7%) and Hispanic infants (84.8%)</li>    <li>American adults continue to consume too few fruits and vegetables. Only 12.2% meet fruit intake recommendations and only 9.3% meet vegetable intake recommendations.</li>    <li>Approximately one in five American adults meet physical activity guidelines for aerobic and strengthening activity. Over $117 billion a year in health care costs are associated with inadequate physical activity.</li>    </ul>    <p>This five-year State Physical Activity and Nutrition Program (SPAN) supports state investments to improve nutrition and increase physical activity that benefits the whole state. This program provides recipients support and flexibility to work on governmental public health systems at the state and local levels to implement evidence-based strategies and to leverage resources from multiple stakeholders and sectors (e.g., agriculture, transportation, education, business, commerce, and housing). Recipients will conduct their work within the state in which they are located.</p>    <p>The approach for this NOFO incorporates strategies to improve nutrition and physical activity as found in a variety of publications and expert recommendations. These include the Dietary Guide lines for Americans (2015), The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding (2015), Community Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation for Built Environment Inter ventions to Increase Physical Activity (2017), and The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Promo the Walking and Walkable Communities (2015). This work builds on previous investments in state health departments and the accomplishments and program outcomes achieved through their efforts under State Public Health Actions to Prevent and Control Diabetes, Heart Disease, Obesity and Associated Risk Factors and Promote School Health program (CDC-RFA-DP13-1305) and State Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity Program (CDC-RFA-DP08-805) in implementing improvements in practices to support good nutrition and physical activity.</p>; <p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>    <p>This NOFO supports recipients to implement statewide and local level nutrition and physical activity interventions that support healthy nutrition, safe and accessible physical activity, and breastfeeding within states and/or the District of Columbia.</p>    <p><strong>Award Information</strong></p>    <p>1.

Established in 1975, TDR is based at and executed by the World Health Organization (WHO), and is co-sponsored by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Bank and WHO. TDR&rsquo;s highest governing body is its Joint Coordinating Board, consisting of countries elected by the six WHO regional committees, resource contributor countries or constituencies, other cooperating parties and the four co-sponsors.</p>    <p>TDR&rsquo;s Mission is &ldquo;To foster an effective global research effort on infectious diseases of poverty and promote the translation of innovation to health impact in disease endemic countries.&rdquo;</p>; <p><strong>Project background </strong></p>    <p>The TDR Information Management System (TIMS) is TDR&rsquo;s bespoke repository for project, grant, grantee and external expert details which contains legacy data stretching back to the 1970&rsquo;s. The TIMS application, originally integrated with WHO&rsquo;s legacy financial system, provided TDR users will a full-featured window into TDR project, grants, their funding and implementation. TIMS was developed by TDR in the 1990&rsquo;s and, while it has been upgraded on several occasions, it must be replaced with a solution that better serves TDR&rsquo;s current business requirements and which is able to consume data from WHO&rsquo;s current enterprise resource planning system, GSM.</p>    <p>Changes in TDR&rsquo;s programme organization and business processes over the years have resulted in a variety of disparate tools created to organize and manage grants and other projects (MS Access, Excel, DataCol, Outlook), resulting in dispersed information which is not easily reported in a consistent manner. TDR would like to improve its ability to report consistently and easily across the programme and continue to build on the repository of TDR&rsquo;s past work. This desire was confirmed by the Sixth External Review of the TDR Programme commissioned by the Joint Coordinating Board (JCB) in 2016 and endorsed by TDR&rsquo;s JCB.&rsquo;</p>    <p>TDR requested an assessment of its legacy system TIMS and other systems / tools in the TDR landscape against the Programme&rsquo;s current challenges and business needs in 2016-17. The results of the assessment suggested that TDR would benefit greatly from a solution which would facilitate grant management (from calls for proposals to project and grant implementation) and which would also completely replace the legacy TIMS system as the main repository for all TDR grants and other projects.</p>    <p><strong>The New Project and Grant Management System business objectives </strong></p>    <p>The aim of the Project and Grant Management System is to support TDR&rsquo;s planning, grant selection and project implementation activities and to replace legacy systems currently used for this purpose.</p>    <p>The new system would combine a typical best-in-class grant management system with functionality and custom data structures required to support:</p>    <ul>    <li>All TDR projects, including non-grant projects (the core data for grant and non-grant projects is the same)</li>    <li>TDR&rsquo;s strategic or &lsquo;portfolio&rsquo;

Between 1990 and 2015, under five mortality decreased by 74 percent from 144 per 1000 live births in 1990 to 38 in 2015).&nbsp;However, neonatal mortality has improved at a slower pace, comprising 61% of all U5MR (Neonatal mortality rate 28 per 1000, Under-five mortality rate 46 per 1000 in BDHS 2014), such that further reducing mortality among newborns represents an urgent priority. The slow pace of reduction in neonatal mortality is considered as a key challenge in achieving SDG 3 target. Achieving the SDG target for neonatal mortality, at 12 per 1,000 live births by 2030, will require accelerating the annual rate of reduction from its current level of 3.4 per cent to more than 4.6 per cent. To achieve this acceleration, some key challenges in service provision need to be addressed.</p>    <p>District Hospitals and even some of Medical College Hospitals in Bangladesh do not have adequate facilities for the management of sick newborns as per the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Sick newborns are mostly managed in the Pediatric Ward without proper quality and safety procedures leading to high rates of case fatalities.&nbsp; There is also lack of compliance with standards for sick newborn care at hospitals largely due to non-availability of Special Care Newborn Unit (SCANU).</p>    <p>Establishment of SCANU has started since 2011 at a few selected hospitals, which have been scaled up to 46 hospitals by 2016 with support from GoB, UNICEF and other partners. UNICEF and GoB have provided continued training for hospital staff members for regular reporting of data from SCANU through individual recording and monthly reporting in DHIS2. With UNICEF support, the database for newborns admitted in SCANU has become an important instrument for ensuring regular reporting and quality of data. However, unlike monthly MIS reporting with aggregated data, a complete individual case-based reporting for newborn admitted to SCANU has been a challenge due to lack of skills and logistics in the health facilities. During the year 2016, more than 45,000 newborns were treated and discharged in 30 UNICEF-supported SCANUs in different hospitals of Bangladesh. With support from GOB and other development partners, the number of districts covered by SCANU has increased to 46 districts (out of total 64) in 2016.</p>    <p>UNICEF has provided technical assistance to develop the SOPs including the generic layout design and implementation guidelines for SCANU which has been endorsed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&amp;FW). UNICEF also leveraged its financial and technical support to the MoH&amp;FW to adopt a national scale up plan for both community and facility based newborn care in recently completed health sector programme (HPNSDP 2012-2016). The Operational Plan for Maternal, Neonatal, Child and Adolescent Health has incorporated newborn health as one of the priority components. It has a target to establish 32 Special Care Newborn Units (SCANU) at the secondary and tertiary care health facilities. Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), UNICEF and other development partners have been working together for establishing SCANUs with minor renovation of physical structure.</p>    <p>There are a number of challenges for the effective functioning of the SCANUs, including shortage of human resources, maintenance of equipment, and monitoring of performance. The ideal ratio of beds to nurses in SCANU is 2:1 whereby minimum number of nurses can be calculated (Total no. of beds divided by total no. nurses). Many hospitals have shown shortage of nurses with the ratio usually exceeding 3 or more. The government is working to deploy more newborn care nurses to meet demand for quality of care for sick newborns. Maintenance of equipment has also been supported by UNICEF through providing technical assistance to government. A technical agency was selected and has provided regular services for maintenance of equipment under the supervision of DGHS. However, due to the overwhelming number of facilities and items to manage, keeping the quality of equipment up to the standard is a challenge.</p>    <p>Further, UNICEF has supported GoB to ensure the quality of services in selected health facilities through 5S-CQI-TQM approach. This included technical assistance to build capacity of Quality Improvement Secretariat in Health Economic Unit of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The quality of services in SCANU has improved with QI programs and guidance from DGHS and UNICEF. However, ensuring quality of service for high newborn care requires multi-sectoral approach with WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) sector for maintaining hygiene and preventing infection, Nutrition sector for improving nutrition and growth of premature and low birth weight newborns, and Communication sector for informing safe and quality newborn care practice in community, and so forth.</p>    <p>As SCANU is a new intervention introduced in Bangladesh at secondary and tertiary level referral hospitals for the management of sick newborn, a performance assessment of the SCANU modelled with technical assistance of UNICEF will inform and guide the policymakers regarding the best practices and bottlenecks for further scaling up of SCANU at nationwide level. The performance assessment will also guide to take appropriate corrective actions to mitigate the bottlenecks by the MoH &amp;FW as well as strategic guidance for improving quality of service through multi-sectoral approaches on better outcome of newborn care in Bangladesh.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>; <p><strong>PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY:</strong></p>    <p>The purpose of this assignment is to carry out a study to assess the performance of SCANU based on the analysis of key data elements and service provision. The performance assessment process will review the background and environmental aspects for the introduction of SCANU from supply, demand and enabling environment side. The performance of SCANU will be reviewed by inputs, outputs, analysis, as well as the observation of newborn quality of care following standard and guidelines.

The GFF seeks to support countries with an integrated health system approach that looks for the best solutions for better Reproductive Maternal Neonatal Child Health Adolescent (RMNCAH) outcomes. The GFF pioneers a model that shifts away from focusing solely on official development assistance to an approach that combines external support, domestic financing and the private sector in a synergistic way. The GFF supports countries in developing a prioritized plan for the health sector that matches the resources available in the short term, and supports countries in strengthening their health financing systems to achieve more sustainable domestic financing. Having full transparency on the amounts and use of external resources is key to this exercise. The GFF support countries in their resource mapping exercises and therefore seeks technical assistance to support Liberia in this effort.<br /><br />Over the last two years, the Health Financing Unit at the Liberian Ministry of Health (MOH) has been conducting an annual resource mapping exercise of planned activities in Liberias health sector covered by donors. The aim of this exercise is to better align partner support with MOH priorities which are identified in its policies and plans (National Health and Social Welfare Policy and Plan 2011-2021, Investment Plan for Rebuilding a Resilient Health System 2015-2021, RMNCAH Investment Case) and to inform the MOH in budgeting and planning processes (for example, to identify resource gaps for specific interventions against Liberias policies and plans).&nbsp;<br /><br />The Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in 2014-2015 led to a big increase in donor funds coming into the health sector to assist the government in addressing the crisis and to rebuild a resilient health sector. However, the MOH faces huge challenges in coordinating the external resources in health. Firstly, partners response rate to the resource mapping survey is low: Approximately 64% of donors surveyed responded with a complete survey while only 48% of NGOs returned a complete survey for the exercise conducted for FY 2016/2017-2019/20. Secondly, the survey is often not filled out in detail so that it is still not possible to identify the activities that these partners are conducting. The result has been a misallocation across investment areas identified in the Investment Plan for Rebuilding a Resilient Health System as well as in the RMNCAH Investment Case where certain areas are over-funded while there exists a gap for others.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW</strong><br />Assignment Title: 1256237 - TA for Development of Health Resource Management System in Liberia<br /><br />Assignment Countries:<br />- Liberia<br /><br /><strong>ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION</strong><br /><br />In line with the MOH joining the IHP+ initiative to improve health results, the GFF seeks technical assistance to build on the existing paper-based resource mapping system and create a digitalized Health Resource Management System. This work will include:<br />1. Develop a concept of the health resource management system based on existing tools and systems (e.g, national health accounts and existing system to track donor commitments and expenditures from Ministry of Finance and Development Planning-MFDP) in Liberia and following best practices from other low-income countries;<br />2. Design and program the digital health resource management system following the approved concept note using data from most recent resource mapping exercises in Liberia;<br />3. Testing and assurance of functionality of the system (data entry, database, on-line reporting etc) and evaluating it to incorporate lessons learned;<br />4.

With the ultimate goal of creating an ""AIDS-Free Generation,"" the division develops and supports the infrastructure and biomedical research needed to: 1) halt the spread of HIV through the development of an effective vaccine and biomedical prevention strategies that are safe and desirable; 2) develop novel approaches for the treatment and cure of HIV infection; 3) treat and/or prevent HIV co-infections and co-morbidities of greatest significance; and 4) partner with scientific and community stakeholders to efficiently implement effective interventions.</p>    <p>NIAID places the highest priority on ensuring the safety and optimal management of individuals who participate in its clinical trials and on obtaining reliable laboratory-based data critical for the meaningful interpretation of study findings. Equally important is the safety of those who perform the laboratory testing.</p>    <p>NIAID aims to achieve comparability between U.S. (licensed labs) and non-U.S. generated study results. The purpose of this contract for Patient Safety Monitoring in International Laboratories (SMILE) is to enhance the ability of current and future mostly non-U.S. laboratories participating in NIAID-supported clinical trials to perform tests in accordance with good clinical laboratory practices and produce reliable test results. SMILE will continue to serve current and future NIAID-sponsored clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups (User Groups), as well as individual grantees conducting clinical research.</p>    <p>The current contract was awarded to Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, under Contract No. HHSN272201300004C, on November 15, 2012, for a period of seven years. Currently, SMILE supports approximately 170 non-U.S. laboratories in 15 countries. SMILE will continue to support laboratories that are part of current and future NIAID-sponsored clinical trial networks (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/hivaids-clinical-trials-networks).</p>    <p><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong><br />The purpose of this Patient Safety Monitoring in International Laboratories (SMILE) contract is to provide a comprehensive and uniform approach for evaluating initial and on-going laboratory capability and readiness to carry out NIAID-funded clinical trial protocols by (1) monitoring laboratories compliance with good clinical laboratory practices, (2) monitoring the ability of laboratories to reliably perform protocol-specified tests by evaluating results obtained with panels of coded samples, (3) providing Labs with various means of assistance, guidance and training to address and prevent recurrence of deficiencies in good clinical laboratory practices and/or proficiency testing, and (4) maintaining an existing computerized data management system and document library that include lab performance data and guidance documents.</p>    <p>The Government anticipates a potential need to (1) expand the number of laboratories serviced by SMILE during the course of the contract, and (2) enhance existing computer software systems to accommodate documents, similar to those managed by SMILE, received from other NIAID laboratory-supporting contracts. Increases in the level of effort for these services would be implemented through the exercise of contract options, at the discretion of the Government.</p>    <p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance:</strong><br />It is anticipated that a cost reimbursement, term/level of effort, type contact will be awarded.

JE virus is also in the higher classification of arbovirus, same as chikungunya, all are vector born and primarily spread by mosquitoes. Japanese Encephalitis virus is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. Each year nearly 68,000 clinical cases of JE occur globally, with approximately 13,600 to 20,400 deaths, primarily in children. Of those who survive, 20%-30% suffer permanent intellectual, behavioral or neurological problems such as paralysis, recurrent seizures or the inability to speak. Assessment of the population impact of vaccination programs shows efficacy in reducing the burden of disease of JE in humans through sustained high coverage in endemic populations. The incidence of JE has fallen dramatically in countries such as Japan, Korea and Taiwan, as a result of JEV use in national immunisation programmesi. As JE vaccination does not induce herd immunity, high vaccination coverage should be achieved and sustained in populations at risk of the disease. WHO's position is that JE vaccination should be integrated into national immunisation schedules in all areas where JE is recognized as a public health priority. There is in line with the most effective strategies for JEV introduction, and clear articulation by WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunisation of policies which support JEV use: ""The most effective immunisation strategy in JE-endemic settings is a one-time catch-up campaign in the primary target population, as defined by local epidemiology, followed by incorporation of JEV into the routine childhood immunisation programme.""</span></p>; <p><strong>PURPOSE</strong></p>    <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">UNICEF promotes the rights and well-being of every child in everything we do.

For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society's most disadvantaged citizens addressing inequity not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfil their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.</span></p>    <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">UNICEF vaccine procurement is guided by the principle of vaccine security: the sustained, uninterrupted supply of affordable vaccines of assured quality.</span></p>    <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">UNICEF is seeking comprehensive and innovative proposals from manufacturers for the sustained and uninterrupted supply of affordable Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine (JEV) of assured quality, to manage any surge in demand in support of routine programmes and catch up campaigns in Gavi countries and self-financed countries.</span></p>    <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to meet the above objective through the establishment of Long-Term Arrangements (LTA) for the supply of JEV to meet demand for routine programmes and Gavi-supported introductions and catch-up campaigns during 2019 to 2022.</span></p>    <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As a result of this RFP, UNICEF will work with selected manufacturers to establish long-term arrangements that best meet the requirements of both parties for ensuring that the requirements of countries and vaccine security objectives are met.

Current BARDA initiatives include the development of MCMs to mitigate systemic injuries caused by exposure to ionizing radiation.<br /><br />Ionizing radiation exerts the greatest effect on rapidly dividing cells, such as those of the bone marrow and the gastrointestinal epithelium. Recent advances have led to the licensure of cytokines to mitigate the resultant neutropenic component of radiation-induced hematopoietic injury. However, it is anticipated that a portion of the patients who become neutropenic will be unresponsive to cytokine therapy leaving these patients susceptible to infection and possible death. Cellular therapies provide a possible treatment option to support the patient's immune system until it has fully recovered from radiation exposure (~21 days). Additionally, ionizing radiation damages endothelial cells and damage to the vascular endothelium likely contributes to the development of systemic and organ specific injury in response to radiation. Cellular therapies may provide the structural, anti-inflammatory and/or signaling components necessary to allow for healing and recovery of the vascular endothelium.<br /><br />Potential cellular therapies for radiation injury include, but are not limited to, embryonic stem cells (ESCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), progenitor cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells isolated from various tissues such as: bone marrow, adipose tissue, placenta, amniotic fluid, cord blood and vascular endothelium. Products that improve homing, engraftment, safety, and/or efficacy of cellular therapies are also of interest.<br /><br />This RFI is for planning purposes only and is issued in accordance with FAR Clause 52.215-3.

The Kyrgyz Republic had inherited from Soviet times a relatively well developed system of water supply. Access to piped water service (i.e., potable water piped into the dwelling, plot or yard or into a public tap/standpipe) was the standard of service for Central Asia. Existing infrastructure, majority of which was built prior to 1980's is now generally in poor condition and very inefficient, with losses estimated on average at 55 percent. Until 2014, there was no national (or local) budget for capital investments in WSS, except those provided by international donors on a credit or grant basis.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Access and quality of water supply and sanitation services, particularly in rural areas remains low. Distances from a home to the nearest water source is much longer for rural households than for urban ones, which implies greater time spent by rural households transporting water for their basic needs. By 2000, a mere 40 percent of rural inhabitants were believed to have access to working water supply systems, while the remaining collected water from unprotected wells, springs, streams, or irrigation canals. According to KIHS, in 2012, not more than 5 percent of the poor rural population had in-house access to piped water. The survey also showed that rural sanitation conditions have remained very poor, with 96 percent of the rural population in 2012 relying exclusively on outdoor pit latrines. These difficult conditions are aggravated by the often harsh&nbsp;climatic conditions and result in significant hardship for the rural population in general, and for women and children in particular.&nbsp;</p>"33289,Program,"Support to the Health Sector's Impact Evaluation Agenda in Panama.
